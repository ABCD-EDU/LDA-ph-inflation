To Americans Thinking of Retiring in the Philippines,1733,yfj0bm,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yfj0bm/to_americans_thinking_of_retiring_in_the/,403,"  

This post is addressed to my fellow Americans who are thinking about retiring here in the Philippines. I’ve lived here for more than a year now and I have some observations to share. I know that I am a guest in this country, but I believe that my experiences should be shared with those also seeking to retire here. I expect that what I say will make some people angry. I apologize. I mean no disrespect. My intent is simply to warn fellow Americans who sub to this sub-reddit who are thinking about moving here. I expect there will be some angry comments and downvotes, maybe a lot, but I’m simply trying to be honest and let my kababayan know that they should think twice before moving here.

A caveat: I live in the province, not in Manila. My experience is therefore based on my experiences living in the province. I know that living in Manila has a different set of challenges, so if you are thinking of living in Manila, some of this may apply to you, but this is mostly directed to those looking to live in the province.

A harsh reality: There are things about living here that you will not like at all. I’ve been here more than a year and I keep telling myself I will get used to it, but after a year, I am still struggling. The categories of things that will be difficult for you to adjust to are: (1) Driving and Roads (2) Shopping/Groceries (3) Filipino Time. This last one is a catch-all and includes bureaucracy, sense of urgency, and waiting in lines. I will conclude with why I am still here and the things I love about living here, which in the end outweigh all of the difficulties I have encountered. 

**Driving and Roads**

This is the most frustrating thing about living in the Philippines. I live in a city of more than 100,000 people and there’s not a single traffic light anywhere. Not even a stop sign. The busiest intersections are a total free-for-all. You can have the right-of-way, be driving down the main road and someone will just pull right out in front of you. I think that Filipino drivers are actually good drivers, they just don’t follow the same rules that we do in the U.S. I am amazed at how good Filipino drivers are at backing into parking spaces and maneuvering in tight spaces. 

A typical road in the province has two lanes in each direction, but people use the right lane for passing. That’s right, the right lane is used for passing because drivers in the left lane sometimes drive so slow you have to pass on the right. There is absolutely no sense of courtesy for moving to the right when a faster vehicle is approaching from behind. And why do drivers just stay in the left lane? Because the right lane is a very very dangerous place to drive. You’ll soon learn that most businesses do not have parking spaces in front of them, so people will pull up to a business in the right lane, put on their flashers and basically park in the right lane. So now that lane is blocked and if you are driving in the right lane, you will certainly have to move to the left several times each kilometer. There are no sidewalks, so people walk and bike in the right lane too, which is another hazard of driving there. One of the more frustrating aspects of the right lane is that road widening occurs before the trees and utility poles are moved. It…is…insane. Instead of moving the trees and utility poles and then paving the new lanes, the new lanes are paved around the poles and trees and they are not removed sometimes forever, sometimes for years. And there’s no warning, You can be driving in the right lane and all of a sudden there’s a tree in front of you. You will also encounter “pipelaying activity” and other road repair works blocking the right lane. These are often there for weeks at a time. 

Pedestrians will walk in the road, at night, wearing dark clothing and you won’t see them until you are right up on them, so please, when you are here, drive slowly. But you’ll find yourself muttering to yourself about these people with an apparent death wish. I don’t think there are vehicle inspections, so many cars have no tail lights and belch black smoke. 

One last note about the roads. In the provinces, people throw their garbage out the car windows all the time. It’s gross. It’s almost as if Filipinos have no sense of pride in their country because they litter their otherwise beautiful country. It makes the area look terrible. This is such a beautiful country, I just wish people would stop throwing their garbage everywhere. You’ll see plastic bottles on the sides of the roads and other trash. I bet you can’t drive a kilometer without seeing piles of garbage. I know everyone doesn't do this but enough people do to make it look awful.

**Shopping/Grocery**

When you live in the U.S. and you need something, you run up to Walmart or Target, or Office Depot, of Lowes or wherever and you pick up what you need. You rarely have to drive more than a couple of miles to find *anything*. Here in the province, there is no Lowes, no Staples, no Walmart, no Target. There’s no CVS or Walgreens. They do have Mercury Drugs and Watsons but the stores are *tiny*. If you need anything out of the ordinary, you will have to order it online from Lazada or Shopee and you will not like the experience. These websites are marketplaces. Like a shopping mall. Lazada and Shopee don’t sell anything. They just display products sold by third parties and when you buy, the third party arranges shipping. As a result, when you have a bad experience with a seller, it’s between you and the seller and Lazada won’t help. As an example, I bought a 750ml bottle of Beefeater gin and when it arrived it was only a 700ml bottle. The seller said their listing was in error and wouldn’t even give me a partial refund. Lazada wouldn’t help. 

Grocery shopping is going to be a disappointment in the province. You’ll find an entire aisle of corned beef and potted meat products and an entire aisle of canned fish, but you’ll be lucky to find more than a couple different salad dressings and you might find one brand of mustard. The selection is not at all what you are used to in the U.S. You’ll also find the cuts of meat to be so so strange. Brisket here is not at all what brisket is in the U.S. You won’t find a chuck roast anywhere. You won’t find Italian sausage anywhere. Short ribs are not the same. T-Bones are not the same. You won’t find a pork picnic roast anywhere. If you do move here I recommend you buy your own meat grinder because the ground beef here is loaded with bits of bone and hard cartilage and fat. Find an S&R (similar to Costco) and you will find Kirkland products and a lot of good stuff you miss from the U.S. but it’s expensive.

Living in the province also means you won’t have easy access to authentic Mexican food, or even Tex-Mex. You won’t have good Italian food, and believe it or not, my town of more than 100,000 has no Chinese restaurants other than Hap Chan which is a terrible chain restaurant. You won’t have Indian food and the best burger you will find comes from McDonalds. The pizza is not at all what you are used to. Most places won’t even allow you to choose your own toppings. But that’s OK, you probably won’t like the pizza anyway.

**Filipino Time**

This is the catch-all. If someone tells you they will be there at 10:00, don’t expect them to be there at 10:00. Promptness is apparently optional here. Almost everything is done by hand. My landscaper trims my lawn using lopping shears. I’m not kidding. Everything takes forever. I took my car to a car wash. It’s done by hand, I have yet to find a mechanical car wash where you just run your car through in 5 minutes tops. Here it’s by hand. I parked in the car wash bay and sat on a bench and watched this guy hand wash my car. He started on the wheels. After 45 minutes, he finished three of four wheels. I am not joking. After almost four hours, I was shaking with frustration as I watched him drag a cloth across the hood of my car. He was aiming for perfection and I appreciate that, but there is absolutely no sense of urgency. No sense of “if I work faster, I can wash four cars a day instead of two and I can double my income.” I’m afraid that until the Filipino economy gets a sense of urgency and efficiency, it will never be an economic tiger.

You will also wait in a lot of lines. I take my wife to the bank and I park at the mall across the street and wait. It usually takes a few hours. People sit in chairs outside the bank waiting for their turn to go inside. I asked my wife why it takes so long. She said when the business inside with the customer service officer is concluded, they will spend 30-45 minutes talking about other products the bank offers trying to sell you something. They don’t care that people are waiting. There is no sense of urgency.

Bureaucracy is a nightmare. I went to get my permanent resident visa at the main office in Manila. There are like 40 windows with workers behind each window and everyone has one task that they complete. You start at one window and they look at your paperwork, Then they tell you to go to a different window. So you wait in line there. The next guy makes sure your papers are in the correct order. Once they are, you go to a different window and wait in line there. I am not joking when I tell you that you will spend an entire day going from window to window. It is so inefficient and you will get very frustrated.

**Why I Stay**

For one thing, my wife is Filipino so we are close to her family. After living together in the U.S. for more than 10 years, I felt it was only fair that she live near her family for at least 10 years too. I wanted to retire early and this was a good opportunity because living here is much less expensive than it is in the U.S. But I sunk all of my retirement into our new home construction so I am pretty much stuck living here even if I wanted to move back. With inflation in the U.S. I would probably have to go back to work at 60 years old.

Also, I really do love living here despite my frustrations with certain aspects. Filipinos are always nice to me and people are always willing to help point you in the right direction. It’s a beautiful country and would be more so without the trash.

So, my fellow Americans, I recommend you give it a test run before committing your financial resources into a house. Rent a place for a year before committing to building a home.",1666947732.0

The driving is a total free for all lmao, I took an LTO driving test and it was absolute chaos driving around town and countryside. Trucks drove like they're chevrolets, motorcycles have fucking 6 to 9 people on it and still have the audacity to cut you off, tricycles use an indicator on a straight road and then turning to the opposite side the moment they are going to make a turn.

Intersections are a race, if you see someone, chances are they are not gonna let you take the opportunity lmao.

Barely any lights and post at night due to it being the countryside, and its a nightmare when brownouts/blackouts occur, which are far too common. I remember visiting the countryside for a week and within that week 3 people died in my town due to traffic accidents. People ridng motorcycles while drunk, fast FX hitting a guy wearing black at the wee hours of the night, and such.

Its one of the reasons checkpoints are becoming more and more common because people barely bother to get licenses, motorcycles were fairly cheap and because of these self taughf people, accidents are common. I took a written exam with 5 other people, only two of us passed.

There's actions being taken to improve this situation but its going to be a good few decades before its totally fixed imo.",1666947732.0

As a local I wholeheartedly agree with all your points especially the red tape in government agencies, lining up for birth certificate can take you a day and a half if you are late.

I was curious though. You live in a city of 100,000 but the choices of products, services and restaurant are too few. I live in a town of around 20,000 people but we have about 3 mustard brands (Nobody buys them though) and many chinese restaurants. Maybe because we're a hub for 3 other towns. Nearest city from me with 200,000 population has a dedicated mall for rich people and foreigners with foreign products and cuts of meat that you are used to. We're in the province too!

To Americans Thinking of Retiring in the Philippines,1734,yfj0bm,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yfj0bm/to_americans_thinking_of_retiring_in_the/,403,"Hey u/MikeyPapapacha

You remind me of my dad. My Southern American dad came here in the late 80s, met my mom, got married, had me in '92, moved to the US, then we all moved back here -- to a province, Cebu City specifically -- in 2000 so he could retire early as well. I've been here ever since (although I've traveled and studied abroad), although now I'm in Manila because I don't want to waste my time in the province anymore. So let me give you a few tips:

1) Lazada used to be just a marketplace, but now they have their own ""Laz Store"" items, or whatever they call it. Look specifically for those items so you don't have to deal with idiot small-time resellers. But Amazon now delivers to the PH, so if money isn't an issue, just go for Amazon.

2) A lot of the problems you're mentioning are specifically because you're in the province. I know this doesn't really help you, but yeah, it sucks. You have to realize that everyone in the province is basically broke except a few select families and their leeches, which is why nothing is mechanized or automated. I'm curious about what actual 100,000 pop town/city you're in though. 

3) On the topic of Filipino time, one interesting theory I've read is that Pinoys don't really have a culture of respecting time because majority of the people are still just a few generations removed from farming. They think in terms of dawn, morning, noon, early and late afternoon, dusk, and evening, which is why they think schedules are just suggestions of what period of the day you should actually do something. I'm not saying this is right, I hate it too and make it a point to respect schedules to the minute; I'm just sharing it as an interesting theory.

4) The Tex-Mex call-out is funny because my dad also specifically missed Tex-Mex, to the point that we ended up opening our own Tex-Mex place about 15 years ago. If you're ever in Manila, the best Tex-Mex you're going to find would probably be Agave, but even then it's not anything like it is back home. For some reason the flavors just don't translate across the Pacific Ocean when it comes to Mexican food.

5) Yes, you will miss the food more and more. I would recommend trips to Manila every now and then because it's the only place you're going to get the kind of food you're thinking about. If you want some more suggestions on specific cuisines, feel free to message me and I'll give you some ideas; I'm sure I know what your palate is missing, as opposed to following the food reviews here which only understand Filipino tastes.

6) If you have kids, make sure you educate them. Make sure they read everything they can get their hands on and make sure they stay away from phones. The education situation here is fucking horrible and the only reason I ended up gaining undergraduate and graduate scholarships for great schools abroad is because my dad played a very proactive approach to my education. There are only about a handful of real ""International schools"" here, while there are thousands of garbage schools that just put ""international"" in their name. Look at accreditations. Again, if I knew where you were I could make better suggestions.

Good luck and have fun. My dad really, really missed good food in his twilight years. Try ordering some steaks on online stores (https://holygyu.com/); those always made him happy.",1666947732.0
To Americans Thinking of Retiring in the Philippines,1734,yfj0bm,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yfj0bm/to_americans_thinking_of_retiring_in_the/,403,"Also, you didn't mention the internet issues ... It sucks.  I lived and worked in the Philippines for 3 years prior to retiring, and when I did retire, I relocated to Thailand.  

Thailand has some of the same issues, such as driving and Thai Time, but the positives outweigh the negatives, especially compared to the Philippines.

The Thai food is incredible compared to Filipino food, especially when it comes to fruits and vegetables.  Also, they have a huge selection of different cuisines from around the world. Today I ate at a French Restaurant for dinner and tomorrow we are going to a German Restaurant for a BBQ of sausages and pork shoulders.  There are amazing pizza and burger joints and they even have craft beer and microbreweries.

The infrastructure is much better in Thailand compared to the Philippines, to include their power grid and the internet.  I pay the equivalent of $35 USD a month for unlimited data on 2 5G mobile phones and fiber in my house and get speeds of 480 Mbps download/400 MBps upload.  When I was in the Philippines, I was lucky to get 15Mbps download and upload was nonexistent.

My biggest concern in the Philippines was crime.  I had been carjacked twice in the 3 years I was there, and had a number of home break-ins.  

I had a safe room in my house that we used as a walk-in safe, keeping most of our high dollar items in there, including bedding and towels.  

We had maids, but even though they were relatives of my ex-wife, they would steal.  Eventually got rid of the maids and just had a cleaning service come take care of the house 3 times a week.

In Thailand, I have dropped my wallet twice getting in and out of cars or taxis, and both times it has been returned to me within a day, with all the cards and cash accounted still in it.

The best move I ever made was leaving the Philippines and retiring to Thailand.",1666947732.0

Air pollution's not that bad as long as you're not staying downtown and there's no garbage that's being thrown out the windows here.

We have to get over our own perceptions just to see anything for what it is and being  'different' is not always a 'bad' thing.  Sometimes, it's actually a great thing.

As for the drivers, I too am amazed at how few accidents there are compared to the utter chaos that sometimes ensues on roads, a testament to filipino drivers, although i would be surprised if they would not have their license revoked after a year driving in the States or Europe.

Filipino time was one of the very first things she warned me about, and it blows my mind that it could be such a universal thing. Driving, too, but I enjoyed driving there a lot, even further out in the province on longer multi-hour drives. I do get the danger and frustration (I once made a wrong turn off EDSA and the traffic was so horrendous that it took me over an hour to get back to where I made the incorrect turn just to get back on track), but because you need to remain so hyper aware of everything while driving there, I counterintuitively felt safer, whether or not that was actually the case.

All of this said, even though I spent a fair amount of time in areas where I did encounter many of these issues you raise, I spent much of my time where her and her family live in either in BGC or Iloilo, both of which (especially the former) have many amenities, so I haven't quite had the chance to *really* experience much of these things longer-term.

I do look forward to going back with her. I do think I have a fair tolerance for the three things you mentioned, so hopefully these things won't bother me much if we decide to spend a lot more time there, as we plan.

Anyway, thanks for sharing.",1666947732.0

Firstly with your desires you rather live close to a huge city otherwise you will keep having a hard time.

The long lines at malls and shops was my number one purpose to get a helper! I do not want to spend my whole day waiting in line for some groceries. But in the Philippines, time seems like it has no value?

For citygoers, if you're a foreigner with very notable foreign features (skin color, accent, inability to command the local dialect), expect people to overcharge you. Be savvy with your cash, but then again, overcharging foreigners isn't exactly unique in just the Philippines (you can find it in other ASEAN countries).

For those looking for love, for males - by god, if someone chooses to become married to you, better hope they're not too close to their family or actually have a moral backbone that isn't 'improve the family.'

Because you're not just marrying to the woman, or dating the woman, you're likely dating the entire family tree.

Fortunately, if you're looking for someone middle-class, this mindset diminishes rapidly. Unfortunately, the ratio is kind of borked, there's tons of lower income people.

Third, there's very little bureaucratic checks and balances here. There is nothing incentivizing ISPs like PLDT and Globe to improve, no matter how much you cuss at them. They're rich, and unless you're as rich as Elon Musk or someone who owns a conglomerate and take them to court, nothing will really happen until you keep pushing the issue one year later.

However, you can get decent Mexican in the city capitals: in Manila or Cebu. Not exactly but I am happy to have a few options in Manila. So if you move here, and that is important to you, it's your choice where exactly in the Philippines to stay. Not researching that part will be your fault. 

Filipino time cuts across geographies in the country though so you are right in that aspect. I hate it when it matters. Being on time is necessary in some situations. But not all.

In the cities, it's because of the awful infrastructure and the lack of decent transportation. People will be late more than half the time not by choice but circumstance so Filipinos, even the ones with Western upbringing, need to take it in stride. I adjust my view of time based on where and what I do. I am Filipino, but I am a stickler for punctuality and delivering on promised time at work and with busy business  colleagues. I relax when on vacation or dealing with people in the countryside. 

In the provinces, it's by choice I think largely. I was in Siargao early this year, and restaurant waiters take their sweet time serving you. It annoyed me at first, but then I realized, there was no reason to rush after all. It made me realize a different way of life is okay. So for the American who seeks that kind of slow life, I imagine  it's a blessing and not a curse.

It's both a good and bad thing though: after working against the clock all the time at a job that requires me to follow time strictly, I appreciate going to the countryside and not get stressed out about being late. Nobody will die if you are not served food in 10 minutes.  In the overall scheme of things, it isn't what matters. However, it is disrespectful if it matters to people who you interact with.

To Americans Thinking of Retiring in the Philippines,1734,yfj0bm,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yfj0bm/to_americans_thinking_of_retiring_in_the/,403,"I've lived in California for 13 years. We now live in Bulacan for almost 7 years now. Though, there's a possibility that we might go back. But yeah, I can relate to what you're saying. Though I would like to add some things.

Get ready for a long read... I got some things to say.

I don't think I can drive here, given the nature of the roads and the motorists here. Unlike here, the roads in the US are more forgiving. There's no tricycle getting in the way. If I need to go somewhere, I'll just commute. Let whose driving the vehicle take all the stress. Though, I don't get it and been wondering. Why won't they just put in traffic lights (like in Metro Manila), I would think the operation costs would be cheaper than to salary a human traffic enforcer? And unlike traffic enforcers, it can work 24/7, rain or shine.

One time, while going from my house to the convenient store (sarry sarry store), I was one inch from being ran over by a motorcycle, and I was walking on the edge of the road, that's supposed to be a sidewalk. I couldn't do anything but to cuss them out on top of my lungs, and then carried on with my day. I swear, many motorists here are inconsiderate!

Another thing, whenever there's a sign saying ""BAWAL MAGTAPON NG BASURA DITO"", which translates to ""THROWING YOUR TRASH HERE IS PROHIBITED."", people would actually throw their trash next to the sign. It's like they're doing it on purpose. It makes my blood boil.

I left here when I was only 9 years old, when I came back here (at age 22), I couldn't believe how undisciplined many people here. Throwing their trash everywhere, peeing on the side of the street, the whole 'Filipino time"" BS, etc. Coming back here was an eye opener for sure. Sure, there are those bad Apples back in California, but it's nowhere as bad as here.

We live next to an irrigation, and it's filled with trash! The kids are swimming into it. I even remember buying a snack at a sarry sarry store, ate it there, and then asked the vendor where's the trash can. They told me to just throw it into the canal. I didn't, and took my trash home with me. That's part of the reason why we have flooding problems here.

Another thing that's an eye opener for me, is how much potholes are on the road, especially here in Bulacan. I've realized that I've been taking California's smooth roads for granted as if its nothing.

Another reason why I don't wanna drive here, is even if it's not your fault. You're still on the hook. For example, my cousin was just minding his own business, he just wants to go home after a long day. Then suddenly a drunk motorcycle driver was speeding, and eventually crashed into my cousin's SUV. The SUV got impounded for more than a year, and despite having evidence (there's a CCTV where the scene happened) that my cousin is not at fault, my cousin ended up being guilty. I guess his family member had connections, and that somehow influenced the outcome of the situation. Speaking of connection, if you don't have any, it's hard to get things done here that involves the government. In America, you don't have to deal with that B.S.

In my area, we're lucky that there's a couple malls within 2 kilometer radius of my house. We have SM, there's a WalterMart that's about to open this December, there's Unitop (which is basically like dollar store, Walmart, and Home Depot combied). And then there's Wilcon (which is like Home Depot or Lowes). If we want to go to a bigger mall or Ikea, Metro Manila is only an hour long drive south. Clark is only an hour drive north. If we wanted to shop at Duty Free stores in Subic, it's also an hour and a half from our place. Beaches in Bataan is only 2 hours. If we miss the colder climate in California, we could also go to Baguio which is 3-4 hours from us.

And since we're really close to Metro Manila. When I buy something from Lazada, it's here the next day. I remember placing an order at 8 PM the evening. It got delivered here in Bulacan, the next day at 9 AM. Even back in California, I never experienced that quick of a shipping. We lived an hour from San Francisco, and the shortest time I've experienced from ordering to receiving is about 2 days.

If we wanted to buy some imported goods, there's an S&R in San Fernando Pampanga, and Quezon City, in Metro Manila. Both are only an hour away from us. And there's a rumor going around that they're planning to expand here in Bulacan, about 5 minutes drive from my house. The nice thing about S&R, is we won't need to drag a box full of stuff from Costco. We can just buy here. Yes, it's a bit more pricey, but at least we can use our luggage for something else.

While Korean restaurants are pretty much in every block here, we're still lacking other cuisine like Chinese, Mexican and American. For that, we have to go to either Clark or Metro Manila. It's only an hour drive, but still, it would be nice if we have one locally. At least there's Classic Savory (Chinese), Champas (Mexican), Kenny Rogers (American) to get our quick fix. Not the best, but better than nothing.

While this country is far from perfect, at least there's some silver lining to this. We're not living paycheck to paycheck. We already own our house. The only thing we have to pay is property tax, which is around $100). No mortgage or anything. Aside from that, our car is already paid off. We only have to worry about electricity (which is pricey, but we'll manage), internet (thank goodness internet has greatly improved here), water, groceries, and my diabetic medications. I'm glad that the price of medications here are regulated, unlike in the U.S., so if you don't have insurance, you can still afford your insulin. And to add to that, at least you won't have to worry about being bankrupt by simply going to the emergency room.

Also, I like that I can get mobile data that doesn't have an expiration date. Meaning, I don't have to buy every month. Just when I run out. And if I wanted to, I can get unlimited data for as little as 300 pesos ($6) a month, through Smart. Wanna make unlimited calls and text? Just add $6 more.

Not only that, our family and relatives are nearby. We get to see each other often. Unlike our relatives in the U.S., which we only see each other 3 times a year, since the time in the U.S. seems to be more fast-paced compared to here.

Politics doesn't really affect us (though I didn't vote for you know who, our current president), and if it does, we're just a ticket away from leaving.",1666947732.0

Guess you could have used the warning eh? If you have a laid back personality, the country will be much easier to tolerate for you, especially if you move further to the south.

Arguing about the value of time is pretty much a lost cause here. I myself get [downvoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y820u6/comment/isyibli/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) whenever i try to point this out. ppl will get angry if you try to tell them their nonchalant attitude toward time wasting is wrong.

Regarding driving, I pretty much tell foreigner friends to not try it, since the country has its own archaic set up. You get used to it. Basically, just assume everyone on the road is an idiot and you will be just fine. also, too many ppl here don't realize they cannot be seen at night when they wear dark clothes. that's just how stupid most Filipinos are. that's also why you can see many driving without lights at night. they just assume if a light is shining on them they can be seen. lmao.

try to ask ppl and they'll be surprised to find out their vehicles cannot be seen if they have no lights at night. in some cases, they even turn off their lights when they encounter oncoming vehicles (because their vehicle only has high beam and no low beam lights). not one fucktard has realized turning off their lights will make them disappear from sight. lmao.",1666947732.0

To Americans Thinking of Retiring in the Philippines,1734,yfj0bm,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yfj0bm/to_americans_thinking_of_retiring_in_the/,403,"So you moved to another country that has a different lifestyle and is less expensive to live in and you're.... surprised that there aren't as many amenities and the roads are poorer than in the US? 🤔

I'm not asking this sarcastically, but have you ever traveled outside the US? And I don't mean a cruise ship, but actually been to other countries for any amount of time?

It's unfair (and reflects poorly on you IMO) to complain that things in a country you moved to because of a lower cost of living isn't able to support you in the lifestyle you enjoyed when living someplace where you paid more taxes and things cost more.

Let's look at the things you listed:

1) Roads and Driving. These are actually two different issues. One has to do with money for upkeep, the other often with cultural differences as well as lack of infrastructure. While it looks like the outgoing President was trying, but just like in most of the world, implementation of large projects was poorly done. A combination of 'managers' with no real experience in the projects they are supervising combined with workers the don't always have the right training and education lead to what you see. 

2) Expecting to be able to get the same things overseas that you were able to pick up at Walmart is..... misguided. The people that live there eat differently, cook different, wear different clothes and have an entirely different outlook on the important of things than you do. Why would they have more than one kind of mustard when that's not an ingredient used very often in their dishes? 

3) As far as the slow pace of work, well maybe hustle culture isn't as important to everyone? Didn't you say you'd retired? What do you care if it takes 3 hours for your car to be washed? Take a book, relax and maybe strike up a conversation with someone. Not everything needs to be done quickly. 

I've spent quite a bit of time in Sicily and Mexico, so I can sympathize that working through a slow system can be frustrating, however the sooner you stop trying to hold THEM to YOUR standards and accept the way THEY do things, happier you'll be.",1666947732.0

also, traffic jams is a result of far too many people opting for private cars coz government doesn't prioritize good infrastructure and mass public transport.

there's usually not enough public transport in the provinces that you can often see people riding on top of jeepneys out of a lack of options.

so they end up buying cars, which adds up to the congestion, and each time they expand the roads, not only is it unable to catch up to car ownership growth, induced demand makes more people wanna buy a car 

coz the temporary band aid solution of road expansion gives the illusion that there would be enough space.. 

narrator : there isn't.

it should have been obvious to anyone who studied geometry. any LGU who want to fully expand the roads and parking lots to accommodate every household having a car, then that ""beautiful"" province inevitably gets converted into an asphalt wonderland.",1666947732.0

I'm afraid to drive in the Philippines. I always take public transportation. 

The stores in provinces are like you described, but in cities they have some big malls and grocery stores with more of a variety. I was on a tight budget so I couldn't afford all the American food. I mostly just ate the local food because it was cheaper.

If you're a big person don't expect to find clothes your size. You probably won't be able to find a t shirt bigger than a large or a shoe size bigger than US 11.

The frogger method is the most common way to cross the street. Filipinos will completely ignore any lights at crosswalks. 

Learn at least a little bit of their language. They'll think you're so cool if you can carry on a basic conversation. 

If there's a big event prepare for your neighbors to have speakers stacked all the way to space and play sound so loud it just might create a black hole and destroy the planet. Hyperbole aside, they do like their music loud and they'll have a huge array of speakers sometimes. You might not be able to sleep if there's some big celebration.

This means expanding rail lines and stations of

- PNR
- LRT
- MRT
- Subway

This would applied in the whole of [NCR & neighboring provinces](https://i.imgur.com/TGXYksw.png). Other major cities like Metro Cebu, Metro Davao, Metro Zamboanga, etc will also follow as well.

It is designed to absorb 100% of today's vehicular traffic so that when construction is completed in 6-12 years it would absorb >80% because more people will be alive by then who live in cities.

This service will be ₱1-10/km more expensive than public

- jeepney
- motorcycle/tricycles
- pedicabs
- buses
- rideshare & taxis

Reason why it will be more expensive as follows

- accelerate paying back construction cost
- somewhat protect pre-existing public transportation stakeholders
- fund paid retraining or reskilling for other domestic or international jobs of displaced public transpo workers. 

Above mentioned public transport will incur a phaseout of vehicles aged 10-25 years starting from their registration date with selective renewal based on demand of route.

Vehicle numbers will shrink to ~20% of what it is today due to lack of demand. People who are rendered jobless of the phaseout will be offered paid retraining or reskilling for other domestic or international jobs. Funds will be sourced from the fares from commuter fares. That's why mas mahal siya.

Our roads will then repurposed to have car-width sidewalks, dedicated motorcycle & bicycle lanes. Some lanes may be eliminated to create greenbelts of flowering & fruiting endemic trees like mangoes or narra.

Car ownership becomes a luxury of the top 0.01% not because of added taxes but because you do not really need it as rail will be omnipresent in urban areas and interconnecting provinces together.

Obesity rates will drop to those of Japan as people will walk 0.5-1km daily from their home/work/place of interest to the nearest station.",1666947732.0

We had a casual chat about inflation and politics. He had claims abouts the Marcoses that I never heard of before (i.e., Marcos senior lend 179 countries money during his term and these countries will only pay back the Philippines if another Marcos is the president; the gold the Marcoses own). I refute these claims with facts and resources. I  even pulled up a document about the global gold reserve (I have it on my ipad as I was reading about it), his response: ""Mas paniniwalaan ko po sinasabi ng Nanay ko kesa dyan sa sa data na yan"". 🤦‍♀️

And on the 179 countries that are in debt to the Philippines, I told him that I am a researcher being paid by the government and as far as I know, there is no such thing - told him there is no such record in any government office. I said that if such transaction is true and it is not in documented by the government, it means that Marcos Sr. is ""cheating"" the Filipino people or that claim is untrue at all. He's response was the same - he'd rather believe his unreliable source than facts. 

For all his claims about BBM, I always ask what his source was. He said his mom, tiktok and other people around him. I told him my source to refute his claims are well studied data and the government itself. 

We also brought up the condition of transportation here in Philippines, and I shared my experience in foriegn countries where public transpo is owned and run by the government and that drivers of these public transpo are considered as gov't employees with benefits and stable income. I compared it with the OVP Leni's project during the 1st few months of the pandemic when her office provided transportation for those stranded in Manila. I also brought up the Libreng sakay project of Joy Belmonte. All he said was, ""Sana gawin din yan ni BBM. Dadali sana buhay namin.""
My response was, ""He can, if he want to.""

Also he hates these women. He also hates Duterte by the way. He even said that only BBM has a pabahay project which I once again refute. 

It's so sad that even if they have access to correct information they would just believe what they want to believe.

You can’t have a civil discussion when they start with the premise that BBM has been persecuted and must be protected. ALL politicians deserve to be scrutinized, no one has the perfect platform. They all have flaws.

It starts by dropping little kernels of information for them to follow like a trail of breadcrumbs. Most people like to formulate their own biases and prejudices from their own observations. Tiktok, Youtube, and Facebook does an excellent job on doing this with the Shorts feature. There are two class of propagandists from my tenure: the ones who are clearly biased, and the ""faux-independent"" thinkers, the latter of which have a more skill-intensive job of tipping neutral issues towards their perspectives.

So to convince them, you make it seem like they came up to that conclusion organically. Make mountains out of molehills for every mistake your enemies make. Make gateway echo chambers that spouts the objective reality, but with a slight bias to your side. Make sure that humor there will be unrestricted (that means little to no policing. It gives them the false sense of freedom within the community).

Over time, they themselves will seek more ideology-focused groups that will further radicalize them. Newcomers to this deeper echo chamber need to be love-bombed with like and charismatic words of approval.

The Liberal voting bloc failed in this country for over 6 years because they took the moral high ground, was out-of-touch for the primitivistic lower class, and was too averse in using propaganda themselves. This gave the Trapos an asymmetrical advantage in the culture war.

If the Liberals want to regain the momentum they've lost since 2015, they have to learn how to use subversive tactics themselves. I understand that most people in this sub value their moral righteousness (and use it as a selling point), but that's exactly what gets exploited during every election season. ""Radical Love"" is the most recent proof of this failed doctrine.

Let's make this thread a safe space for the anti-Leni.

**Hindi bobo** ang mga anti-Leni, whether pro-BBM o anti lang talaga sa Leni supporters. May mga hinanakit din sila. 

Pakiramdam nila kaaway nila tayo kasi brainwashed tayo, mga pa-woke tayo, o puno lang tayo ng galit kasi

*""Puro reklamo lang kayo at si Leni, wala na kayong naitulong sa bansa!""* &nbsp;
*""History is written by the victors!""* &nbsp;
*""Puppet lang si Leni ng oligarchs!""*

Let us address all their pervasive misconceptions in this thread.

Suggestion: pag may makita kayong toxic comments throughout r/Philippines, instead of downvoting or being prejudiced, reply with the link to this thread. 

Example:

*""Maybe this might help: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/qx82zk/replying_to_misinformation_against_leni/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share""*

or just comment the link.

Kahit pa bagong account yan, give them the benefit of the doubt. Malay natin ayaw lang niya gamitin main reddit account niya knowing the negative results on karma. 

Kung ayaw talaga niya at talagang hindi niya ganun kamahal ang bayan, edi wag nalang natin pilitin. At least tinry natin magkaintindihan.

Send niyo rin dito yung mga nagtatanong lang, gaya ng ""ano ang pros and cons ni Leni?"" para malaman nila.

&nbsp;

#TO THE ANTI-LENI

**Please comment below** if may tanong kayo.

Gusto rin namin malaman ano yung sobrang ikinagagalit niyo sa amin at kay Leni. Ilabas na niyo lahat ng hinanakit niyo.

Hindi natin kailangan mag-agree 100%, pero para lang mas magkaintindihan tayo.

&nbsp;

#Request: Let's stop downvoting anti-Leni comments at mag-reply ng walang bahid ng galit.

&nbsp;

#Misconceptions
&nbsp;

##1. Mahina yan si Leni, walang political will, puro pa reklamo!
&nbsp;

Paglilinaw: 

Ang hindrance sa ating progress na humihila sa'tin pababa ay hindi ang criticism o pagpuna sa'ting government officials, kundi ang ating intolerance at galit sa criticism. Maganda ang sinabi sa [article na ito](https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/03/19/opinion/columnists/topanalysis/criticizing-as-a-form-of-civic-duty/704176). 

Habang hindi naman tayo gumagawa ng threats o nagdudulot ng harm sa'ting kapuwa, walang masama sa pag-express ng frustrations o konting humor sa mga mali sa ating lipunan at gobyerno. 

Mas ok pa rin yung aware tayo kesa magpikit mata tayo na parang mas mahal na natin ang isang public servant kaysa sa bayan. Balansihin din natin.

Hindi ito pagrebelde o pakikipaglaban sa gobyerno, kundi pag-call out ng inefficiencies at incompetence, at pagsuporta na rin sa checks and balances ng ating lipunan para hindi maabuso ang kapangyarihan.

At hindi komo nagrereklamo, hindi ibig sabihin wala tayong ibang ginagawa. Si Leni nga andaming reklamo ng lugaw na yan, pero halos araw-araw ring nagtrabaho simula day 1. 

Ang gusto lang namin kay Leni, kahit kailan hindi siya pagalit mag-voice out ng criticism at malumanay siyang nagbibigay ng suggestions for improvement. 

Kaya marami rin ang akala ay mahina at walang political will si Leni kasi malumanay siya. Pero hindi siya mahina kundi matapang. Isipin mo, presidente na mismo ang pinupuna niya, kahit alam niya ang negative effect sa image at popularity niya dahil alam naman niya ang kultura nating mga Pinoy na napaka-allergic sa criticism. Kita naman natin ang backlash sa Facebook posts niya na flooded ng laugh reacts at toxic comments. 

Pero bakit ba talaga si Leni nagvo-voice out? Ramdam niya ang mga hinanakit ng taong bayan kasi andun siya mismo parati sa ground at may kamalayan siya sa kalagayan ng mga tao. Like yung pag-una pa sa dolomite sand, sabi niya ito raw ay [insensitive](https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/08/manila-bay-white-beach-an-insensitive-plan-in-time-of-pandemic-solon/) kasi magbuhos sana dapat muna ng lahat ng resources at attention sa pandemic, which is a valid point 'di ba? Dahil alam niyang kapag mas mabilis maka-return to normal ang labor force natin, mas mabilis aangat muli ang ekonomiya natin.

&nbsp;

##2. Puppet si Leni ng oligarchs!
&nbsp;

Paglilinaw:

Unlike sa panahon ni Cory na may injustices laban sa mga magsasaka, kahit bago pa si Leni tumakbo for any public office, no political plans or agenda, bilang lawyer ay mahusay niyang ipinagtanggol na pro bono (walang bayad) ang maraming marginalized sectors.

Halimbawa ay ang paglaban niya para sa mga lupa ng Sumilao farmers against sa conglomerate by the name of San Miguel Corporation. Naipanalo nila ang kaso laban sa mga elite. Kaya hindi nakakapagtaka kung bakit todo ang suporta sa kaniya ng mga [Sumilao farmers](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/779322/sumilao-farmers-to-march-not-for-land-but-for-robredo).

Iba iba rin ang ugali ng individual na members ng mga partido, hindi lahat masama o lahat mabuti. Halimbawa, sina Cory at Duterte ay parehas na kabilang sa PDP-Laban, na sinimulan naman ni Ninoy. Kakapalit lang din ni Sara recently. 

Makikita rin natin sa SALN ni Leni na hindi siya kasing yaman ng most politicians, kaya noong sinampahan siya ng kaso ni BBM, may volunteers na nagbuo ng [crowdfunding campaign](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/803171/piso-para-kay-leni) to support her legal fees.

Anong ginawa niya? At her own personal risk, she politely declined to avoid graft at ipinamahagi lahat ng funds sa Angat Buhay program, especially sa housing projects sa Marawi. See [here](https://gogetfunding.com/piso-para-sa-laban-ni-leni/) for more details. Also search for ""Jeanette Concepcion Patindol Piso Para Kay Leni"" on Facebook.

This speaks volumes about her integrity. 

Isa pa, her office consistently received the highest audit rating from COA for [3 straight years](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/6/29/OVP-highest-audit-rating-COA-third-straight-year-.html).

Ilang beses na tayong umasa sa mga napakagandang pangako ng mga politiko, so it might help if i-apply natin ito sa **lahat** ng ating candidates:

Kahit gaano kaganda ang mga pangako, plano, at plataporma ng kahit sinong candidate, kahit gaano kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, at katindi ng kaniyang political will, ang mas reliable indicator ng kanilang totoong character ay hindi ang kanilang words, hindi rin ang words para sa kanila ng naging allies nila or ng sikat na vloggers or influencers, kundi ang kanilang **past actions**. 

She takes quick actions. At ang lahat ng ginawa niya bilang VP ay **initiatives** lang niya o kusang loob—hindi part ng mandates ng OVP—dahil siya ay isang servant leader.

&nbsp;

##3. History is written by the victors!
&nbsp;

*""Napakarami namang infrastructures ang ginawa noon. Binenta ng mga dilawan ang mga pagmamayari ng bayan!""*

Paglilinaw:

Ang ""history is written by the victors"" and ""corrupt naman lahat, at least may nagawa"" ay tinatawag na fallacious generalizations o mga logical fallacy dahil sa insufficient evidence at overreliance on observations o panlabas na nakikita.

Kailangan natin makita ang bigger picture para malinawan tayo.

Graduate ako ng Economics sa UP kaya kahit nasa 30s na ako at nakalimutan ko na most of my lectures on development economics, kahit papaano ay may kamalayan pa rin ako at paggamit ng critical thinking para ma-separate kung ano ang propaganda at hindi, at kung ano ang nangyari sa ekonomiya natin.

Oo, napakaraming ginawang infrastructures. Walang mali dito kung careful at proper ang pag-spend. Ang problema ay maraming cases ng overspending dahil sa cronies at mga rushed projects. Read more [here](https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/building-spree).

Meron namang magagandang projects gaya ng San Juanico Bridge, Philippine Heart Center, Lung Center of the Philippines, dams, at napakarami pang iba. 2 dekada ba naman e.

Kaya lang napakalaking spending din sa failed investments gaya ng controversial Bataan Nuclear Power Plant na ang cost sana sa contract ay $0.65 billion pero biglang naging $2.2 billion. Read [here](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/).

Ang malala pa ay ang napakalaking ginastos din sa tinatawag na edifices para magmukhang may progress pero in the long run ay hindi masyadong nakatulong sa ating economic growth gaya ng CCP at Manila Film Center.

Ang problema, ito ay debt-driven o puro galing sa utang sa world bank. Mula around $0.6 billion utang bago maluklok si Marcos, naging $26.7B pagkatapos. Read [here](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/774774/well-pay-marcos-debt-until-2025).

Paano natin malalaman kung **overall** ay maganda ang investments natin sa infrastructure? Ito ay kung lumago nga ang ating economy. Matapos ang 2 dekadang pamumuno niya, anong nangyari sa economy natin?

Do Marcos apologists give you any economic data, kahit ano gaya ng yearly GDP growth rate, o sinasabi lang nila na ""naramdaman at nakita"" nila ang progress at prosperity noon? Oo, maganda naman talaga ang simula, pero tignan natin ang long-term effects.

Tinatawag nila itong ""golden age"" kahit nag-collapse ang economy natin sa early 1980s dahil hindi na tayo makabayad ng utang sa world bank at nagka-recession during his term. See [this image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ekHZ98nz5fx8pZQe8306y7-CsJhawpPy/view) (verifiable at the PSA website) sa GDP growth rate ng economy natin under Marcos and a more detailed analysis [here](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/content/172779/martial-law-costly-lessons-in-economic-development/story/). 

Ang problema kasi, pinagbabasihan lang nila ang mga nakita nila at own experiences lang. Oo, maganda at payapa ang buhay nila, pero hindi nila nire-represent ang buong bansa. 

Bagsak ang economy leading to massive **inflation**, tapos isisisi nila lahat sa next admins. 

Sobrang negative din ng tingin ng marami sa privatization o pagbenta ng government firms kaya isisisi nila lahat sa Aquinos, pero may times na mas efficient pa mag-manage ng business ang private sector, kasi nag-invest sila mismo, kumpira sa government na may inefficiencies and red tape. Halimbawa, ang Bangui Windmill Farm ay owned and managed by a private corporation.

Hindi ako dilawan dahil wala naman talagang perfect na adminstration—may injustices din under the Aquinos—pero sana aware tayo na iniwan ni Marcos na sobrang lubog ang bansa sa utang or [high debt-to-GDP ratio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gBNetxycVYTwzR2_Sd_7joD2Qdv7klda/view?usp=drivesdk) at bagsak ang ekonomiya. Ang privatization ay kahit papaano nakatulong ma-manage ang ating utang.

Sana wag magbase lang sa outward appearances or facades of progress. Tignan natin ang mas malawak na konteksto kung bakit talagang napag-iwanan tayo.

At kahit gaano kagaling ang isang leader (kahit pa may photographic memory siya), kagaling siyang magsalita, ka-inspiring ang kaniyang vision, o katindi ng kaniyang political will, ito ang hard lesson sa atin:

Competence is important but not as important as character.

&nbsp;

##4. Puro charity lang yan si Leni! Band-aid solution. Di yan para sa long-term progress ng bansa natin!
&nbsp;

Paglilinaw:

Hindi naman dahil nag-take siya ng initiatives na tumulong ay ibig sabihin noon ay wala siyang kamalayan sa long-term na makakatulong sa economic growth. 

Hindi VP ang nagco-control ng spending natin sa infrastructure. Pero graduate si Leni ng Economics sa UP Diliman. Alam niya ang kahalagahan ng infrastructure kaya itutuloy niya ang [Build, Build, Build](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/10/29/2137559/robredo-says-continue-anti-drug-campaign-build-build-build-tweaks?fbclid=IwAR12U_l5GuBHL7F35BZxZqYU3esc2T965Enw7pWpvyXzyhDzQ_zfJHiFF6s) pero makikinig din siya sa ating best civil engineers para ma-address for example ang ating traffic and congestion sa urban areas.

Nakita rin natin ang kaniyang efficient management of resources at [achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leni2022/comments/qkl0wk/megathread_achievements_and_statements_of_maria/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) as VP kahit relatively maliit ang budget na inilaan sa OVP.

At makikinig din siya sa mga experts and our best economists. Ang kaibahan sa kaniya, mas confident tayo na hindi niya nanakawan ang kaban ng bayan.

Alam din natin na maglalagay siya ng professional leaders na nararapat sa bawat department, hindi yung nilagay lang dahil sa pabor o para ma-enforce ang kapangyarihan.

&nbsp;

##5. Bayaran ang media!
&nbsp;

Paglilinaw:

Oo, hindi perfect ang media, pero unlike most vloggers na clearly biased, ang media ay much more under threat na mahabla o maaaring makulong kung lumabag ito sa batas.

Let me illustrate:

In case lang naman na sobra kang amazed o hanga kay BBM for ""his"" Bangui Windmill Farm, let's get the facts right.

Oo, ina-acknowledge natin na he eagerly permitted, facilitated, and inaugurated its construction according to [this opinion piece](https://manilastandard.net/mobile/article/367795). 

Similar to his parents, alam niya kung gaano kalakas ng hatak ng votes ng sights of [big infrastructures](https://opinion.inquirer.net/145027/our-infrastructure-fetish). Gamit na gamit nga sa campaign niya halos lahat ng videos ay may kasamang windmill animation.

Pero tandaan din na ito ay initiated, constructed, and financed not by the government but by the **private sector**. For complete details, see [here](https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=aSsvkRokkSYC&pg=PA83&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjDv8yWiNvzAhUuGKYKHfugAbcQ6AF6BAgGEAI#v=onepage&q&f=false).

Pag binasa natin 'yon, si **Ferdinand Dumlao** ang isa sa nag-initiate ng Bangui Windmill Farm. 

Ngayon itong si **Thinking Pinoy** inaakusahan niya na mali mag fact-check si Rappler. Ang claim kasi ni TP ay yung Bangui Windmill Farm ay initiated by BBM dahil si Dumlao daw
kasi ang ""Ilocos Norte's Provincial Special Projects Manager"" ni BBM. Watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGHpACXoXH4&t=14m00s&feature=youtu.be) at the 14:00 mark.

Pero magkaibang Dumlao kasi 'yon. Ang under ni BBM ay **hindi** si Ferdinand Dumlao kundi si **Chito** Dumlao. Read [here](https://www.manilatimes.net/2004/11/23/news/regions/bongbong-furious-at-ilocos-norte-killing-spree/683199).

At ang daming naloloko.

Tandaan, **hindi** reliable source ang napakaraming Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok videos dahil punong puno ito ng propaganda, ilang taon na. Wala sila madalas na reference na binibigay, puro accusation at stories. At kung may reference gaya ni Thinking Pinoy, mina-manipulate nila to fit their narratives.

Hindi naman masyadong mahirap pag-isipan kung saan nanggaling ang makinarya ng propaganda. Tsaka yung iba rin ay nare-reinforce nalang ng positive feedback ng community nila at ng [Dunning Kruger effect](https://www.britannica.com/science/Dunning-Kruger-effect#:~:text=Dunning%2DKruger%20effect%2C%20in%20psychology,or%20of%20people%20in%20general).

Tapos magke-claim ang mga apologist na bayaran ang Rappler at ABS-CBN na nag-report din naman sa katiwalian under the Aquinos at previous admins gaya ng sa Mendiola—see this [report by Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/nation/mendiola-massacre-anniversary-same-injustices). *Hmm... Sino kayang candidate na kabaliktaran ni Cory at [ipinagtanggol](https://www.manilatimes.net/2016/04/13/news/top-stories/sumilao-farmers-choose-leni/255921) ang mga farmers at mga mahihirap laban sa mga elite?*

Since they cannot attack the evidence, their tactic is to target the sources (media) at siraan sila. 

Kaya wag naman tayo masyado padala sa mga sikat na influencers gaya ni Ka Tunying, yung INC na vlogger. Ok sana kung mag-cite siya ng sources, kaya lang kadalasan ay chismis style lang. Pero mabait naman siya, misinformed nga lang din at feel niya pinagtutulungan siya kaya para sa kaniya, masama tayong lahat. Valid naman ang point niya, wag dapat ipairal ang galit. 

&nbsp;

##Edit: I had an idea. 

What if ang volunteer animators natin ay bumuo ng inspiring video animation, na may nagna-narrate using this explanation? Kahit yung 1st, 2nd, at 4th misconceptions lang. Para pati yung mga tinatamad magbasa ay ma-enlighten. Baka may ma-contact kayo. Yung with inspiring music gaya ng kay William Capistrano et al. tapos gawing ad. Suggestion lang naman. 🙂

As the title says, I felt more proud to be Taiwanese nowadays than Filipino especially after May 9. I saw myself suddenly learning Mandarin and even celebrating Double Ten (which is a national holiday in Taiwan celebrating the 111th anniversary of the ROC) today. I just feel ashamed to be Filipino right now, especially with what's going on in the country today. 

Inflation. Attacks on media (Rest In Peace Percy Lapid). Crises in agriculture and education. Peso slowly losing value to the US dollar. I don't know what's happening right now. Back then, 2000 pesos can buy me a lot of groceries, even during the time of bastos. But now, I could only get a small bag of goods with that same amount. 

I am also tired of pointing blame and finding scapegoats. Because no matter how hard I try to make Unithieve supporters realize their mistake, either by being compassionate and empathetic or being direct to the point, nothing will happen. And I don't think they will listen anyways. They'll just say ""eH kUnG iKaW nAlAnG kAyA mAgiNg pReSiDenTe"" or ""sUmUnOd kA NaLaNG. dAmI mOnG dAdA. NPA kA Ba?""

Taiwan is experiencing a lot of problems too. I mean, they also have issues with inflation and that problem with Mainland China. But I am glad with how they are able to overcome them. On top of that, they have an awesome President like Tsai Ing-Wen who, while a woman, have more balls than BBM and his allies. While she is standing up to China, Baby M is trying to extract benefits from America while also trying to appease China. Friend to all, enemy to none my ass. 

Back then, I never emphasized my half-Taiwanese part of my identity, especially during that time when the Coast Guard shot Taiwanese fishermen near Batanes for crossing our waters. I felt shame having Taiwanese and Chinese roots. But now, I don't know anymore. I am having an identity crisis right now. Sorry.

PS. Before you say ""eh di dun ka nalang sa Taiwan kung ayaw mo dito sa Pilipinas,"" yes I plan to go to Taiwan anyways. Also, if you have that kind of logic, if you have problems with your sink, just leave your house. If your car breaks down, just leave it there. If you experience health issues, just let the disease kill you. If you have any problems, don't attempt to solve them, just give up.

OP, I think you meant Batanes, because if the Taiwanese fishing vessel got close to Batangas, we should have the right to detain the crew and fire upon the ship lol.

But I'd say this though, Filipinos (especially in this subreddit) are looking for something to be ""proud"" of in this country, when honestly, that shouldn't matter anyways. Our identity is that of our shared culture, and regardless of what people may say, that's what we are eh, for good or bad. We can't abandon or change who we are, and no amount of good governance will ever change that, we just evolve to keep our identity to the sign of the times.

Citizenship doesn't matter because it is nothing more than  belonging to a certain nation (Or territory). But Ethnic National Identity refers to the attachment of one's ancestry, tradition, culture and language. Thus, you don't need to be proud of a certain nationality, you just need to belong in said community. You are a Filipino with Taiwanese roots, and nothing could ever take that away from you. You know the cultures, both the good and the bad of both societies, so it is up to you to choose what your personal identity will be.",1665375612.0

Nepal borders has already got slowly taken by China and India in recent years has gotten to a border conflict with China.

The Philippines position with China and the US is not complicated. Philippines relies on both China and the US for economic growth and they want to maintain friendly ties with both to prevent any escalation, so Marcos stands seems reasonable to an extent.

Also keep in mind the US is the largest economic partner of china, so it makes sense to mirror what the US does considering they are the country that leads as an example to others ...

While you criticize Marcos for cooperating with China, Biden originally planned to buy most of their solar panels from china, most US companies were just recently drag out of china thanks to trump trade war with them and thank heavens Biden administration follows trump foot steps in that direction just after recently mainland china's declaration.

Isn't that info you normally keep private or visible only to friends?) to ask them face to face what they saw kay JR. and hopefully report their sharing of fake news and libelous statements to opposition candidates and their supporters to their Human Resources. Based on my observations, I've noticed the following -

1. Either todo deny sila they voted for BBM or sa mga posts nila (most of which involve fake news, paninira or bardagulan) kahit na I am showing it straight to their faces. I mean Kakampinks are proud they voted for Atty. Leni, so are those who voted for Yorme, Pacquiao and the other candidates pero most of the apolo10s I meet and know deny JR. Parang mga jeepney, taxi, tricycle and Grab drivers along with middle-aged people lang ang proud to have voted him in person pero ung mga bata-bata (20's - 30's), todo deny. Is it because they realize their mistake na or sadyang nakakahiya lang maging associated with the Marcoses, even through the ballots? They've won, shouldn't more of them be proud of it?
2. Common reason nila for their posts is nahack, identity theft, hiniram ng friend or relative ung account (do people seriously do this? Di ba unsafe ung ganyan), lasing daw nun or sarcasm lang.
3. Andaming apolo10s na service crew, blue collars and BPO agents. Gets ko na malaki chance mauto ng mga service crew and blue collars due to the lack of decent education for most of them (no offense meant pero that's the stereotype) pero ano kaya nakikita ng mga BPO agents kay JR? Same question goes to the highly-educated folks who voted for him. Parang karamihan ng mga trolls work in a BPO or restaurant or food kiosk. Di naman nila ako masagot kasi like I've said - many of them deny they ever supported or voted Jr.
4. Most trolls I've met, even those who are related to me and former friends, ay malalaki katawan - either obese or muscular (again, no offense meant, observation ko lang).
5. They consider it foul to report their posts sa employers nila yet before, during and after the elections - todo kalat sila ng fake news, libelous statements and even threats in some cases. As an HR practitioner kasi, if you made your employment public, everything you do or say might reflect sa company mo. I mean, would you really want to be served by someone na nagkakalat ng mga fake news and foul statements or if business owner ka, would you really want to be associated with internet trolls?

My fellow Kakampinks and even my supervisor, na Isko supporter, is currently suggesting I stop doing this due to possible dangers and risks pero I plan to continue doing so - siguro irereport ko na lang sila sa employers nila online or daanan ko na lang pag merong apolo10 na nasa ruta ng fieldworks. Nabalot kasi ako ng galit recently, enough for me to gain the strength to confront some of them directly. Harap-harapan na kasi tayong ginagawang tanga ng Philippine government pero sila todo depensa pa rin dito, kahit na karamihan sa kanila ay nararanasan ung mga shortcomings like our terrible transportation system and inflation and as an HR - pet peeve ko ang wrong choices pagdating sa tao who will be required to do a certain job.",1658241746.0

Mine are quite similar to yours.

Actually, even way before 2016, I've been most curious about why so many Filipinos are like this. That they can easily voice out their thoughts and sentiments online for whatever they believe in, but are so incapable of being able to express them intelligently enough to have constructive discourse, yet alone participate in a wider audience to bring about positive social change.

But more importantly, why?

I'm no sociologist or behaviorist, but I suspect that the reasons and causes for this go deeper. Being ""straightforward, upfront and direct"" are NOT typical Filipino traits. Pressing further as to why, well, it could be the simple lack of ability to even form the proper statements for expression. Matters of politics and economics are very complicated issues for laymen after all. It could be the lack of confidence in standing up for one's beliefs in public. It could even be that some people are duplicitous whether intentionally or inadvertently -- they say one thing but mean another. Yet still, they could simply be malicious -- being aware that posturing as an apologist towards kakampinks is ""fun"" because, well, trip nilang makipag barda all the time every time -- deliberate belligerent behavior, so to speak.

When you're serious about wanting social change, encountering people like these makes it soo frustrating. And I feel the same way you do, OP. I'm just not sure if direct confrontation is a good idea, or if anything meaningful might come out of putting myself in such a situation.

But then again, OP, you might have better ""persuasive powers"" than I do lol",1658241746.0

"Can a country’s president bankrupt its Central Bank? Ferdinand Marcos did that in 1983, and today, generations of taxpayers not yet born during Marcos’s time are still paying for those bad loans the Marcos regime took out and wasted.",52,svjmsw,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/svjmsw/can_a_countrys_president_bankrupt_its_central/,2," [Bankrupt by Boo Chanco](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/02/16/2161033/bankrupt)

Can a country’s president bankrupt its Central Bank? Ferdinand Marcos did that in 1983, and today, generations of taxpayers not yet born during Marcos’s time are still paying for those bad loans the Marcos regime took out and wasted.

I remember those bad old days. I was with PNOC at that time and Saudi Aramco wouldn’t load any crude oil to our very large crude carrier (VLCC) parked at their Ras Tanura port unless we paid in advance. We used to get 60 days of credit.

I was privileged to join a mission to negotiate oil supplies around the same time. We used our company Learjet because it would facilitate our movement from one oil producing country to another. Besides, the aircraft was due for maintenance in Germany and was flying in that direction.

Our pilots carried several duffel bags full of dollar bills to pay for refueling our aircraft and other needed services. Our usual credit card was no longer honored.

They were not taking chances with us. The whole world knew Marcos drove the Philippines to the rocks. There was not enough foreign exchange at the Central Bank to pay for imports, including essential medicines.

 Those were the days after Ninoy Aquino was killed by the regime. The country’s political situation was volatile. Business confidence was down. There was capital flight, further exacerbating our precarious foreign exchange situation.

Then prime minister Cesar Virata was worried enough to take former Central Bank governor Jaime Laya and Cesar Buenaventura, the private sector representative to the Monetary Board, to New York to talk to our bankers.

Little did they know that the situation was worse than they imagined. As soon as they sat down with the head of the lead bank managing our account, they were told that the Philippine foreign exchange reserves were overstated by $600 million.

“We were caught with our pants down,” Buenaventura told me in an interview last Saturday. The banker told them there was nothing to talk about until they got their financial statements in order.

Buenaventura said they knew they had problems, but they were shocked to hear how bad the country’s situation was. Neither Virata, who was also the finance secretary, nor Laya who was CB governor, had any inkling.

The first order of business was to avert a debt default.

So they rushed back to Manila to verify the information they were given. They got SGV to go through the numbers, and sure enough they were told the $600 million overstatement was true.

The country was broke. It was caused by a combination of factors constituting a perfect storm. The Marcos cronies couldn’t pay PNB, DBP, GSIS, giving rise to a crisis among the three GFIs. Also adversely affected were crony banks: Traders Royal and UCPB.

Principal exports like sugar and copra were suffering price declines. In the meantime, prices for essential imports like oil were rising fast. Capital flight worsened after the assasination of Ninoy. In short, we had a forex crisis.

It was also found that PNB branches moved money to branches in another time zone with the same going back before banking hours opened in the sending branch. It gave the impression we had more dollars than we really did.

The economic managers had to face the reality of having no more dollars in the Central Bank to pay the banks or to pay for basic imported necessities like oil. Virata knew they had no choice but to request for a debt payment moratorium for about $20 billion in outstanding debt to some 300 banks.

But the banks did not even want to talk to a Marcos government official. Virata knew they needed a new CB governor with enough international gravitas. They turned to Jobo Fernandez.

It took a while to convince the veteran banker to take the job. When he finally agreed, he sat down with Virata and company to assess the situation. At the end of it, Buenaventura said Fernandez remarked: “Gentlemen… the way this looks it seems we are just shuffling deck chairs on board the Titanic.”

The sudden collapse of confidence from international financial institutions made it difficult for the Philippine government to get debt relief, much less to borrow. Both were needed to cut the increasing budget deficit.

The government had to impose import controls and implemented foreign exchange rationing.

Forex access was primarily for the purchase of crude oil and petroleum products. All others had to get their own forex from the black market.

To make sure the Central Bank had enough forex to pay for crude oil, then trade and industry secretary Roberto Ongpin tapped the Binondo Central Bank. Ongpin met weekly with five or six of the top Binondo blackmarket traders of forex and decreed that they supply so much forex weekly at a set price.

The dollar bills were packed, flown by private plane to Hong Kong, and deposited presumably in the Central Bank account at PNB Hong Kong. That simulates forex coming into the system to at least cover oil purchases. The country was on a hand-to-mouth existence for its forex requirements.

The Central Bank also created a fund to guarantee payment of airline tickets at guaranteed rates. The airlines refused to accept the unstable peso for payment.

To address the threat of runaway inflation, the Central Bank introduced the so-called Jobo Treasury bills, which paid interest rates as high as 38 percent, to mop up liquidity. However, this may have also contributed to the rise in the cost of goods. They also hoped the high interest rate of the Jobo bills would attract foreign exchange.

The economic mess got worse. Stagflation set in and GDP contracted for successive years. As a result many businesses failed.

The peso was devalued from P8:$1 to P14 then to P20 from 1983 to 1985.

A tough IMF economic stabilization program induced severe recession. The Marcos government had to cut overall government expenditures to reduce deficits.

Epilogue: Marcos bankrupted the Central Bank; it had to be dissolved and replaced by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. Its bad accounts are still being paid for by taxpayers.

# FOOD IN METRO MANILA IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN IN JAKARTA

In general, food is about 20% more expensive in Metro Manila than in Jakarta, even though Jakarta and Indonesia's per capita are 20% higher than in the Philippines.

There are two interesting observations I made while doing this chart

* Indonesians like to buy groceries online in marketplaces like Shoppee and Tokopedia as shown by the number of ratings, Many of the produce sellers have 1000+ ratings. Some of the Indonesian prices on the marketplaces are cheaper than in Jakarta's markets, sometimes cheaper by 20-30%.
* Some common vegetables that I didn't list are much more expensive in the Philippines than in Indonesia. Carrots are Php 140 / Kilo or US$ 2.44 / Kilo.  In Tokopedia a kilo of carrots goes for about Rp [12,000 to 10,000 / Kilo or US$0.80 to 0.67.](https://www.tokopedia.com/find/wortel) It is why people are trying to smuggle [Chinese carrots into the Philippines.](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1574554/local-carrot-farmers-lose-p2-5m-daily-income-to-smugglers)

The lower food prices mean Indonesians spend less on food as % of their income than Filipinos, according to the article [Why the Philippines Is So Vulnerable to Food Inflation](https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/07/13/why-philippines-is-so-vulnerable-to-food-inflation-pub-87467), food makes up 22% of Indonesia's Consumer Price index, while it makes up38% of Philippines",1663556153.0

Not surprising with cooking oil. They're a major importer of palm oil. Much to the detriment of their forests, unfortunately.

FALSE - given the fact that the entire world knows Marcos Sr. isn't a hero, it is debunked.

""Mainstream media are bias and liars""

FALSE - SMNI is the only biased news that spread lies and propaganda. And look at that, the founder is also a sex offender, nice.

""Marcos never stole anything, his family was rich before he got elected as president. It was the Americans who try to make him look bad because they don't want a country they can't control""

FALSE - Marcos stole 860.8 million dollars (or 43.04 billion dollars adjusted for inflation). It was transferred via an anonymous swiss account. If you're talking about China, who is also as rich as the USA, it's not hated by the USA because they can't control them, but rather they are placing too much censorship.

""During Marcos time ASEAN countries were afraid of the Philippines""

FALSE - yes, they are scared not because of his ""plans"" but rather cuz he is a dictator

""Marcos Sr. first term was good""

PARTLY TRUE - yes, his first term was nice, infrastructures are under his presidency. But in his second term, he decided to be stupid and be a dictator instead

""When Cory took over, it was the start of Philippines downfall""

FALSE - In 1965 - $1 = 1 pesos  
1986 - $1 = 20 pesos  
Poverty rate in 1965 - around 2-5%  
Poverty rate in 1985 - around 20-30%

""He declared martial law to prevent the spread of communism""

FALSE - In Magsaysay's term, there was communism around the country, but what did he do? Correct, they never declared martial law, not a single one. They decided to make the communist parties surrender to the authorities which Marcos should've done instead

""Cory shut down the Bataan nuclear power plant to prevent meralco from being bankrupt. If they didn't shut it down, we would have cheaper electricity""

FALSE - Cory didn't shut down the Bataan nuclear power plant just because theirs is going bankrupt. It had over 9000 defects and it was built on the fault line which is vulnerable to earthquakes. If it didn't shut down we would be the next Chernobyl

""Mendiola massacre is all Cory's fault""

PARTLY TRUE - Yes, Cory is the fault here, but that dosent mean cory is a bad president

""The victims of Martial Law were communists and law breakers""

FALSE - Everyone got killed, including the critics against the dictatorship of Marcos.

""America is scared of the Philippines during Marcos' term, so they asked the oligarchs (or dilawans) to make a revolution""

FALSE - This has nothing to do with America, even Lee Kuan Yew says he is a dictator

""Lee Kuan Yew is an American puppet, he was paid to say that""

FALSE - Lee Kuan Yew made Singapore a first world country, even richer than us Filipinos. If Marcos was never elected, we would be as rich as Singapore instead

""Bias at sinungaling ang mainstream media""

MALI- ang SMNI lamang ay ang news network na nagkakalat ng kasingulalingan at propaganda. At tignan nyo oh - yung gumawa nyan, sex offender pa. 

""Hindi nagnakaw si Marcos, mayaman yung pamilya nya bago naging presidente pa sya. Ang mga Kano ay sinasabi lamang na diktador siya dahil ayaw nila ng bansa na hindi nila pwedeng imahalà""

MALI- Si Marcos ay nagnakaw ng 860.8 milyon na dolyar (o 43 bilyong dolyar sa kasulukuyang panahon). Trinansfer ito gamit ang anonymous na Swiss account. Kapag tinutukoy nyo ang China, na mayaman din katulad ng Amerika, hindi sila ayaw ng mga Kano dahil hindi sila pwedeng mamahala roon, pero sa dahilan na masyadong masikip sila sa censorship.

""Noong panahon ni Marcos, takot ang mga bansa sa ASEAN sa Pilipinas""

MALI- oo, takot sila hindi dahil sa mga ""plano"" nya, pero dahil siya ay isang diktador

""Maganda ang unang termino ni Marcos Sr.""

PARTIALLY TRUE- Oo, maganda ang unang termino nya, madami siyang ginawang infrastructure. Ngunit sa pangalawang termino niya, lalo siyang naging tanga at naging diktador sya. 

""Noong naging presidente si Cory, simula na ng downfall ng Pilipinas""

MALI- Sa taong 1965- 1 dolyar = 1 peso
1986- 1 dolyar = 20 pesos
Poverty rate sa 1965 = around 2-5%
Poverty rate sa 1985 = around 20-30%

""Nag-deklara sya ng Martial Law para ipatigil ang pagpakalat ng komyunismo""

MALI- Noong panahon ni Magsaysay (1953-1957), may presensya ng mga communist sa bansa, pero anong ginawa nya? Tama, hindi sila nag-deklara ng martial law, KAHIT ISANG BESES, HINDI. Ang ginawa niya ay ipa-suko ang mga partida komunista sa mga awtoridad, na dapat na lang ginawa ni Marcos, imbes na ideklara ang ML

""I-shinutdown ni Cory ang Bataan NPP para hindi malugi ang Meralco. Kapag hindi nila shinutdown, magiging mas mura ang kuryente ngayon""

MALI- Hindi ishinutdown ni Cory ang Bataan NPP sa rason na malapat na maging bankrupt ang Meralco. Madami ang depekta ng Bataan NPP (higit sa 9000) at itinayo ito sa fault line, na diretsong apektado ng mga lindol. Kapag hindi nila ishinutdown, ang Bataan ay parang magiging Tsernobyl ngayon.

""Kasalanan ni Cory ang Masaker sa Mendiola""

PARTLY TRUE - Oo, si Cory ang may kasalanan pero, hindi ibig sabihin na palpak na presidente si Cory

""Ang biktima ng Martial law ay ang mga komunista , kriminal, at aktibista na galing sa UP""

MALI- Lahat ay ipinatay, kasama na rito ang mga nag-babatikos kay Marcos noon

""Takot ang mga Kano sa Pilipinas noong panahon ni Marcos, kaya ipinautos nila ang mga oligarko (o dilawan) na magsimula ng rebolusyon""

MALI - Walang kinalaman ang America dito, kahit si Lee Kuan Yew, ang Prime Minister ng Singapore noon, ay nagsabi na isa siyang diktador

""Si LKY ang tuta ng mga Kano at mga Dilawan, binayaran nila si LKY para sabihin iyan""

MALI - Si LKY, ginawang 1st world country ang Singapore, mas mayaman pa sa mga Pilipino, Kung hindi lang nanalo si Marcos, magiging mayaman tayo katulad ng Singapore.

if they would go through the usual process then CBP or BSP ang magpro-provide ng loan sa private individual, this in turn would make help move the money within the country without relying heavily on foreign loans, 

with this we are hitting 2 birds with one stone, 

first, with cbp/bsp generating revenue from the local loans and increasing the local purchasing power of each working filipino (of course it comes with great risk)

second, is lowering the current government debt by offloading some utilities to private enterprise

An Empty Victory vs Reigniting a Movement,43,uovdoq,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uovdoq/an_empty_victory_vs_reigniting_a_movement/,13,"Yes, they won the election.  Be it clean or dirty.  Be it landslide or neck and neck.  Then what?  What do they do with their victory?  They invade the comment section, they invade our walls, they invade our tweets, rubbing it in our faces that they’ve triumphed.  They want to kick us when we’re down.  But that’s about it.  They didn’t gain anything of value.  

Compared to us, they lost ties to some of their family members, they lost friendship, and more importantly they lost their humanity and principles.  All they have is an empty victory, a temporary dose of dopamine, and it feels just the same as rooting for the winning team in a sport.

A quote from Lebron James perfectly describes this:

*""All the people that were rooting [for Leni] to fail, at the end of the day, they have to wake up tomorrow and have the same life that they had before they woke up today.  They have the same personal problems they had today.  [She’s] going to continue to live the way [she] wants to live and continue to do the things that [she] [wants] to do with [her] family and be happy with that.  They can get a few days or a few months or whatever the case may be on being happy about not only [Leni], but [also her running mate and senatorial slate] not accomplishing their goal.  But they have to get back to the real world at some point.""*

A weakened economy that is less market friendly to foreign investors, a balooning national debt, inflation, the increase of prices of goods, the increase in the contribution of Philhealth, the looming talks of mandatory ROTC, and a growing distrust in the new government, that’s what they have to look forward to.

We gained friends, a passionate community who we share common values, the youth who will be the foundation of a better Philippines, the adults who instill their values inspired by Leni Robredo onto the youth, and the support of the elderly who never forgot history and wants to continue to fight for the next generation.

For Leni Robredo, she has accepted the results of the election.  Although it’s sad and heartbreaking for us to watch the end of her campaign,  the campaign that gave us hope to have a functioning government by the people, for the people, she moved forward and started a new movement.  To continue her lifelong mission to help the poor, the indigenous, the neglected, the marginalized.  A groundbreaking organization that already has 15 million volunteers, donors, and sponsors before it even began, and that’s just the start.  We hold on to our shared beliefs and values, that we see in our leader that inspires us.

Her thanksgiving event today was not the spark to ignite the movement, it was the fuel, the motivation to keep us going.

*“Motivation is like fire - unless you keep adding fuel to it, it dies.  Your fuel is your belief in your inner values.”*

*“Walang nasayang. Hindi tayo nabigo.  Pinakamahalaga, hindi pa tayo tapos, nagsisimula pa lang tayo.”*  -VP Leni Robredo",1652458767.0

My idea on what the next step for the Kakampink Movement should be,29,unsy2o,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/unsy2o/my_idea_on_what_the_next_step_for_the_kakampink/,10,"Long post. Tl;dr: Our movement has to transition from being an election movement to an issues-based movement that can demand solutions to the very real issues of everyday filipinos and criticize or commend the sitting administration for their inability or ability to address said issues. An example of issues and specific proposals to solve said issues are down below near the end.

-------

When asked about investor anxiety and how BBM would adress such, Stephen Cuunjieng said in an ANC interview:

""When Duterte appointed Sonny Dominguez as Finance Secretary, investors calmed down. Sonny Dominguez was in our eyes as investors the best choice for the future of Philippine monetary and fiscal policy. So BBM has to appoint the right people otherwise he won't last long. It's the same with every presidency.""

This made me think that we *all* have been caught once again focusing too much on figureheads, personalities, and vague policy declarations for the past decades when our focus should've been understanding what our candidates were specifically going to do if they won. Who will they appoint? What is their priority? Etc. Etc.

Cuunjieng would later say in his interview that the reason this country still stays the same is that we Filipinos don't demand enough in the realm of specific policies and structural issues the country is facing.

I believe the Pink Movement has to evolve into a new mission, instead of solely attacking Uniteam. We need to start being critics, moderates, and accept what good the next administration may do as well as criticize what the administration does badly. 

As for our movement, I'd like to give contributions as to the policies and issues we must advocate specific solutions for. I don't have a name, or slogan so bear with me.

- To combat price inflation of basic goods like food, the issue of food security needs to be solved by subsidizing and insuring the education and modernization of local agriculture while working with friendly, stable neighbors or global partners to secure staple foods without paying too much of a price. Storage, management, and system of transporting food needs to be reformed to ensure minimal wastage.

- Housing security and the lack of robust, decentralized urban development is another issue for both those in the rural areas and those in congested urban areas. Ways we can solve this are by reducing our dependency on major urban centers like Metro Manila and Metro Cebu. We must encourage other cities to urbanize through road and city planning standardization laws, prioritizing walkability and liveability similar to Japanese cities and making a clear template and guide for cities to grow. Local Public transport must also be taken into consideration. With newer smaller urban centers, the availability of housing with the benefit of opportunities will decongest our major urban centers and allow more decentralized and local economic and social development.

- Public Eucation is still lagging behind in the Philippines, and two of the major causes are the lack of proper funding for the schools and education materials, and teachers not being paid on time. These two key issues must be addressed by making reforms to the education system which may include increased funding and pay for teachers and schools, assisstance from schools of our global partners to help educators especially in fields of Math, Science, and English Comprehension.

Those are some policy ideas I can think of right now. I don't expect this to be THE policy statements we need, but it could be an example of how specific we have to be in our demands from the government. I sure hope that our movement becomes an issue-based, united organization of Filipino citizens concerned for the very real structural and socio-economical issues of our country.

What needs to happen is to make sure these words come out of the mouths of candidates that can win. This ""movement"" needs to become a true political party.

Our politicians **do** think and act about this. But genuinely important issues are mixed in and conflict with family considerations: how to maintain and increase their economic and political predominance. You cannot demand reforms out of someone interested in maintaining the status quo so you need to emphasize **pre-election** work as much as post-election critique.

So what's the strategy? Just like the dynasties, we need bailiwicks. In this case a matrix of interest groups and geographic areas. Make them politically aware and patient enough to bind them to the party so they don't flake. Control potential candidates by centralizing and ensuring visibility of finances, and establishing primaries. Win elections by making sure candidates are just as charismatic and eloquent as they are smart. Market our policy preferences well and make them seem important/do the reverse for the opposing side. Deliver on the promises by balancing short-term wins and long-term solutions. Make our social base happy and graduate the masses to our base's level and repeat.

Lastly, in our capacity as private citizens, we really need to be more ambitious. Start businesses, start NGOs, start whatever. We need to complement political action in order to survive electoral downturns.

I know I'm making it sound easy (you know it's not) but this is what we really need. We need as many Leni as possible with (oh my god) Robin's charisma.

If Marcuck Jr. will win, it would mean the end of everything. Foreign investors would most likely migrate as the Marcos surname scares possible investors. 

A Bloomberg reports that several Philippine investors are not optimistic a Marcos presidency will help the country's economy rebound.

UK think tank Capital Economics in February said the Philippine economy will continue to underperform or do even worse if Marcos wins, citing his lack of plans for pandemic recovery or fiscal policy.

The reason to this is probably the lack of governement experience and credibilty of Marcos.

I will cite here an article published by Business World:

""PHILIPPINE investors are lukewarm to the prospect of a Ferdinand “Bongbong” R. Marcos, Jr. presidency, with Vice-President Maria Leonor “Leni” G. Robredo emerging as their top pick to oversee an economic rebound, according to a Bloomberg poll.

&#x200B;

A survey of 28 investors and analysts gave Ms. Robredo the highest score of 106, followed by Senator Panfilo “Ping” M. Lacson with a score of 91 and Manila Mayor Francisco “Isko” M. Domagoso with 81.

&#x200B;

Mr. Marcos and Senator and boxing champion Emmanuel “Manny” D. Pacquiao were at the bottom with a score of 46 and 44, respectively.

&#x200B;

Investors who were asked who they think is the best person to lead the Philippine economy ranked the five candidates on a scale of 5 to 1, with 5 as the top score.

&#x200B;

Ms. Robredo, who trails Mr. Marcos in most voter polls for the May 9 presidential election, has pledged to prioritize stamping out corruption and enabling pandemic recovery and job creation.

&#x200B;

Mr. Marcos, the son and namesake of the late dictator who ran the Philippines when it declared bankruptcy in 1983, vowed to aid the farm sector, improve traffic flow on Manila’s roads, push for the use of renewable energy and fight communist insurgency.

&#x200B;

At stake is the revival of the Philippine economy, among the fastest-growing in the world in the last decade until the pandemic cut hundreds of thousands of jobs and triggered a record contraction.

&#x200B;

President Rodrigo R. Duterte, who is limited by law to a single six-year term, is targeting expansion of as much as 9% this year.

&#x200B;

“What we need is a captain who will bring us out of the storm,” said Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist at BDO Unibank, Inc. “The next leader must be able to address the economic and social crises we are confronting, to put us back on the path to faster growth. How our markets will perform will depend greatly on that.”

&#x200B;

Almost all the respondents in the poll conducted from late February to early March predicted that an economic expansion of at least 6% could be sustained in the next six years. Managing the pandemic and cooling inflation are the biggest priorities for the next government, according to poll results.

&#x200B;

“If Marcos is elected, it would only reinforce our view that the economy will continue to underperform over the coming years,” Alex Holmes, Asia economist at Capital Economics Ltd., wrote in a February note, citing his tax case and a lack of achievements when he was senator. Mr. Marcos’s camp said he is qualified to be president despite the tax conviction.

&#x200B;

The former senator led a January poll by Pulse Asia Research, Inc. with six of 10 Filipinos voting for him. Ms. Robredo was a far second with 16%, while Messrs. Moreno, Pacquiao and Lacson got less than 10%.

&#x200B;

Ms. Robredo narrowly defeated Mr. Marcos in the 2016 vice-presidential election, which he protested. The Supreme Court eventually rejected his claim of rampant fraud in some provinces.

&#x200B;

“Marcos, in our view, will likely be regarded as less market-friendly than Robredo, particularly when it comes to experience at the national level and in articulating a strategy for the country to recover from the pandemic,” Nomura Holdings, Inc. economists including Sonal Varma wrote in a January report.

&#x200B;

Domestic factors such as the policies of the next government will be the biggest drivers of the performance of Philippine markets. The peso, the worst performer in Southeast Asia this month, will likely stay below the 52-a-dollar level by the end of the year, according to the Bloomberg poll. The peso, which has weakened by 2.5% this year, traded near its Sept. 2019 low at 52.29 on Friday. 

&#x200B;

The benchmark stock index, which has fallen by almost 10% since Mr. Duterte took office in 2016, is forecast to rise above the 7,500 level by the end of the year, while 10-year bond yields are expected to hold at above 5%, according to the poll.

&#x200B;

The Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed at 7,112.19 on Friday, while the 10-year rate on the secondary market was 5.4801%.

&#x200B;

Mr. Duterte said at the weekend his successor should be a lawyer who is compassionate and decisive.

&#x200B;

“I’m not saying it’s the best quality, but one of the good qualities of a president — hopefully a lawyer,” he said in a taped interview with his spiritual adviser Apollo C. Quiboloy, who is wanted in the US for sex trafficking and other charges.

&#x200B;

Mr. Duterte said a lawyer would know the repercussions of his decisions. The tough-talking leader, whose war on drugs has killed thousands, also said the next president should be compassionate and pro-people.

&#x200B;

Ms. Robredo and Jose Montemayor, Jr. are the only lawyers among the 10 presidential bets this year.

&#x200B;

Mr. Duterte, who canceled his vice-presidential bid last year, has said he would not endorse Mr. Marcos even if he’s the running mate of his daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio. ""

&#x200B;

Even investors prefer VP Leni over Marcos, and probably even Duterte(idk). If Filipinos want economic growth, they should vote for VP Leni.

&#x200B;

Majority of Filipinos like him because he will bring about ""change"", but I think the change he will bring this country is a change for the worse.

&#x200B;

Maybe economic crises will force him to control the flow of information and resort to censorship...Probably he would make an ""Anti-Fake News"" Bill that only targets those that criticizes him. I hope that wouldn't happen...",1652055263.0

I don’t get BBM supporters though.,19,u3e4l6,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/u3e4l6/i_dont_get_bbm_supporters_though/,27,"First time voter here, made this new reddit account few months back. Just want to rant tho. Its gonna be long. 

Here are the common answers I’d get from BBM supporters as to why they vote for their BBM. And some arguments put in the mix.  Most of these answers are from my extended families, friends and neighbors. I just told them that i think Leni sounds sensible to be president. They answered back and these are the answers that i found are still questionable af. 

1. **if we vote BBM, we vote Sara. Sara strong like his father and they will work together to reduce CRIMES!**. This answer struck me and makes me wonder, why? I can vote Sara if you want crime to reduce it but why do i need to vote BBM if that guy has tax evasion problem in the first place? Heck, there are a lot of controversies surrounding BBM.  

2. **vote for BBM so he can return those Tallano Golds back**. Okay, this one is stupid but unfortunately, i got this answers. Why does it takes for him to be president in order to return golds? My friend said that she’d witness BBM handing to golds to people, farmers she said(she lives in Mindanao). And she believes BBM will return more. How is he gonna do that? He can’t pay or may not be willing to pat his 203b taxes, what makes you think he’s gonna return those golds(if this gold still exist)?

3. **He has more years of experience than Leni**. Okay, but what did he do exactly? He was a senator in Ilocos(that’s what they said) but what is something he did exactly? And speaking of more experience, isn’t that enough years to pay his taxes and  that Tallano Gold they speak of? What did he do exactly? I just can’t rely only on the amount of years experience without out knowing what he did to serve the Philippines. 

4. **debates are useless, they’re going to ask the same questions again and again. He is tired of hearing, he’s absent because of this**.  Story time in this part. Had this argument against my mom about it. I literally do not know BBM at all because i rely much on debates and platform they presented in the debate rather than their campaign ads, their spokesperson or from their supporters. All i want is to hear the guy himself said it. She said that if he attend the debates, he will be ask some controversial again. “That’s the point!” I shouted back. “He should have prepared to answers to those questions if it is being repeated again. I’d be happy to answer those questions again if it was repeated in a test knowing what the correct answers or at least, the answers of.” She exclaim, NO he shouldn’t attend. So i put her on perspective. “You keep coming and asking me how to email pictures and other computer stuff again and again for the past decade but i still answered it again. Why can’t he?” Also point out that service workers such as cashier or doctors can deal the same questions being asked on them and they still answer it why can’t he? In the end, i just want to ask BBM supporters why debates are useless to them?

5. **Golden Years!” They said this proudly and badly want to experience it again. Like How? They want the Nutribun thingie they use to get before, they say that everything was cheap and everything was very “safe” back then cause crime so low. I told them about the inflation rates and how I don’t think it will comeback to the things they use to experience. 

6. **If we vote Leni, crime would be high, a lot of phone and purse snatching, the street wouldn’t be safe and we have to hide ourselves at home just to feel safe** My only answer to that was “what? How? How is it correlated to these?” How does crime rates will be so high if Leni became our president? I’m so confuse on this part and this bothers me much. 

7. **he is a strong man where Leni is a weak leader cause she’s woman**. Mom told me this answer (ironic) and im like “you’re my mom” how is it a woman equals to weak leadership? I’ve seen a fair share and experience in class group where a woman is a leader. Most of them can be organize and are found to be a good leader and can handle a situations when arises. So I’m not sure why is this a good reason to vote for BBM and not Leni. 


8. ** i wont vote Leni cause she’s a Dilawan or communist** i dont get it. How? What’s wrong with Dilawan’s and how is she a communist? Is this label only stuff? cause whenever they mention it, i find these label stuff very discriminating like you would label to a black person with the N-word. Theres a post i found that says “what color do you see?” With the picture of the word “PINK” and font color is yellow. “Anyone want to explain that?” I asked this question to BBM supporters only to receive some answers that’s lead to more questions or either get mock or insulted by them. I don’t know why is this a thing but i just want to know their answers genuinely. 

9. **Leni tanga and other insults** “How?” This questions when i ask BBM supporters is either ignored or answered thats completely unrelated. Its bother me that some of these BBM supporters either doesnt listen to cause Leni. Why?

10. **have you notice Leni’s supporters? They comprises of rich business and theres a possibility that some of them are involves with drugs and drugs trafficking therefore crimes will be so around here** dafaq? The hell did they get that? Told them that doesn’t make BBM any better considering he have government officials involved in plundering.

11. **his father, Ferdinand Marcos Sr. Supported local production and we aren’t use to buy exported products. Now a days, there are a lot of exported products and therefore making local producers and local business poorer** how? Are they sure? What are they trying to prove here?

To be honest, im seeking answers to their claims listed above.",1649931441.0

3. Like his benefactor, Arroyo, he is also seen as someone with a deeper insight in politics just because he is born in a family of one and held several positions. For the gold, refer to number two.
4. He, or rather, his PR team doesn't see the benefit of him attending one. He will be the butt of everyone's jokes and the questions will always finds its way to Martial Law which has been hounding his clan for decades. They deemed debates as a liability rather than an asset to his campaign, thus ignoring it when it doesn't suit him.
5. Believe it or not, their golden years are like true love. It is real, but not for everybody.
6. Leni will likely follow the liberal footsteps of Pnoy. If Kris was to be trusted, Pnoy described her as a successor and we all know the annoying tanim-bala era of his.
7. Gender is not the real issue here with Cory, Gloria, Miriam to name the few who grasped powers on their own. It's that most Filipinos still subscribe, even women themselves, to the fact that women are supposed to be at home and politics are the business of men.
8. As said on number six, she is shown and claimed as the successor of LP (dilawan).

This was my martial law take when I was still rooting for Jr.,11,tpgd17,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/tpgd17/this_was_my_martial_law_take_when_i_was_still/,14,"Orange Sky

     Reality is colorful, so is history. However, what history paints as reality often seem to favor some shade than what reality should truly be is. But that does not mean that all vibrant histories were realities stained by the victor’s hue.

     One such colorful event that really happened was the martial law in the Philippines and the series of events that surrounds it. Colorful in the sense that there was so much struggle between the Reds of Marcos and the Yellows of the opposition that, even today, persists. So many color that even to these days many still argue what it truly was. Was it the Golden Era or the Dark Age of the Philippines? We, as people who was not born long after that era, cannot explicitly rule. Fortunately, we can scrutinize the evidence and observe the present; after all, the present was the product of what happened in the past. These are all for the sake of getting a glimpse of the truth: the truth about the martial law; and the truth which shall set us free from ignorance and tyranny.

     However, before pondering upon the martial law timeline, it is essential to know what the Philippines was like prior to the martial law era to really justify whether this age could be called an age of progress or that of regress.

     The Philippines, before the Martial Law, had a thrilling type of government. We are of democracy; one that welcomes the clashing of the politicians through dynamic and fiery debates of ideas, policies, and governance. It was even considered to be educational for the masses as they can witness these political plays through the brilliant journalists behind the media at that time. And while the politicians were also corrupt, just like they are in the present, at the very least they have the mouth and the brain to be qualified in their position. This was the Philippine Third Republic: an era after the World War 2 and during the cold war; a time when two superpowers in the world are colliding indirectly and thus affecting other countries across the world. The Philippines was not an exemption to this. While the government embraces the ideologies that the Americans had passed to them; the number of people who supported communism were not few and they even became a threat to the peace of this nation. Overall, the Philippines at that time could be compared to a teenager whose main goal was to discover their selves. What was better: a free market or a controlled market? What would be good: democracy or dictatorship? In other words, this era, for both the people and the people in position, was an era of trying. An era that was ended by the late President Ferdinand Marcos when he chose to be a dictator through his Proclamation No. 1081 otherwise known as the declaration of the martial law.

     The process of declaring martial law, though legal, was not easy. It is the culmination of a long preparation by Marcos that could even be arguably traced back at the time when he wrote a thesis about authoritarianism. There were even evidence and testimonies from his own people stating that some of the events that gave the leeway for martial law to be approved were staged just like the “Enrile ambush”. However, not all were proven to be staged by Marcos just like the “Plaza Miranda Bombing” which was speculated by some to be linked to either Ninoy Aquino as he was conveniently absent when the bombing was done or to the Communist Party of the Philippines under Jose Maria Sison. Either way, it only takes one incident that was proven to be staged by Marcos to confirm that he planned the Martial Law. His intent for this could either be because the context was truly urgent, and he still needed some big reason to place the country in martial law to address the issue or he needed to declare martial law for him to be able to stay in power as his term was nearing its end. The thoughts that ran through his mind during those days may now be impossible to be unveiled but how he used the power vested to him by the martial law could be examined to determine what his purpose was in proclaiming it.
 Under Marcos’ rule, several infrastructures and thousands of classrooms were built. And the Philippines, in the early years of the martial law, was impressive. There was a balance of payment surplus and an increasing GDP. However, that was all. Almost all the good things that Marcos had done for the Philippines was only during the beginning. Because, while he had competent people around him, they cannot fully exercise their abilities as they are too afraid to be on the bad side of Marcos. So, as time passed by; because the interests of Marcos, his family, and his cronies were the priority: the national interest was neglected and thus began the downfall of the Philippines. To be fair, these could not all be blamed to the regime as there were many natural phenomenon and outside circumstances that triggered this downfall such as the “Luzon Calamity” and the war happenings on middle east. Both contributed to the inflation of prices and the devaluation of peso. The citizens at that time were frustrated and blamed the government for something that they could not control. However, there were some things that the government can control but they controlled poorly. A series of unfortunate events and a series of lack or poor decision made by the government were to be blamed in the economic crisis at that time. So, the Filipinos’ frustrations were still reasonable.
On the political side, during the martial law, innumerable members in the opposition, activists, and ordinary citizens were either detained, tortured, or killed during the regime. Many media outlets were closed and only the government-controlled ones were able to persist if they do not go against the government. Freedom was not prevailing during those times. And human rights were being broken frequently. These caused even the mild protester to join the armed groups. Ironically, the “Martial Law” move that was supposed to address these armed groups became the reason for these armed groups to grow. And yes, there were certainly many rebels who were captured in this age but there were also innocent lives that were taken because of these. One of which was the tortured and killed son of the journalist Privitimo Jimares which circumstances point out was a doing of the side of the Marcos. This is ironic as the idea of eliminating rebels or criminals was to protect the innocent. If on the way of punishing evil, shall we ever take an innocent live, then we should rather let those evil go than to sacrifice one innocent life. Fortunately, while there are armed groups that are against the government, there were also parties that opposes the regime through non-violent means. Because of this, a full pledged civil war was avoided. 

     However, the state of the Philippines was stagnant. Marcos, with the support of the Americans, held absolute power. No one was able to fight him in the political arena except for the Opposition Leader Ninoy Aquino who he imprisoned right at the beginning of the martial law. Though, these changed when Ninoy Aquino was allowed to be operated in America. After years of recuperating there, he decided to come back and defeat Marcos. But, in an exhilarating turn of events, just as he was about to set foot again in his motherland; he was assassinated. This assassination, whose purpose was to eliminate the head of the opposition to weaken it: did the opposite. This became the trigger. The people were angry. They had realized that they had been taken advantage of. They mourned the passing of Ninoy, but they also did the greatest form of honoring his dead body: proving that his death was not a senseless death. Because of foreign and local pressure, Marcos was forced to announce an election. He run again for the position of president with Cory Aquino, the wife of the late Ninoy, as his opponent. During the election, many computers were manipulated and thus the computer technicians walked away. The Batasang Pambansa continued the counting and announced Marcos as the winner. The armed rebels found this as an opportunity to invade Malacañang. However, they failed. But they were saved. They were saved by an unexpected power: the people; the people’s power. A power that made the Marcoses flee, and a power that appointed Cory as the president: the people. In that moment, the Philippines, after experiencing rule under a dictator found itself in democracy: a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.

     Truly, a marvelous event. The sky at that time, may as well be orange. Not because there were vapors of blood that was shed in the People Power Revolution. But because an orange sky signifies the setting of the red sun and tomorrow; the sun will be yellow. This is a historical event that made the whole world tremble. Reminiscing this should awaken the blood of the heroes in our veins. We, Filipinos, should take this history as a lesson, that whatever may happen; the essence of our being is kindness to our kin. We ought to remember that this revolution became bloodless because as the military men approached the activists, they welcomed them with kindness. During those time, the weapon that the people had used was their kindness as portrayed by a soldier when he said that how can he bare arms against those people if they welcomed him with smile while they are holding rosaries. And, to Marcos, that even though he had the power to order an attack against the civilians, he did not. He was a tyrant, but he allowed his ousting to become bloodless. And while he can be included in the group of bad dictators, he was not the worst of them. This brings the question, was his regime a golden era or was it a dark age? For me, it became the process of knowing what we truly are as a nation: a nation that is of the people, by the people, and for the people driven by love and kindness for our beloved motherland.

Disinformation is not effective unless it strikes a chord within the current Filipino Psyche. So what do Filipinos feel now? A great uncertainty and fear for the future. Rising inflation, post pandemic, jobloss, world war possibility ---- the future looks very dark.

Why do they choose the 'Golden Era' narrative? 
Why is it easier to lose trust in mainstream media? 
Why have they become so jaded in their belief na 'better corrupt na may magagawa than someone honest pero di ko maramdaman?'

It is very difficult to combat the organized troll farms. So, we will have to create messages that their troll farms will be baited to share and target audience will propagate even more. 

Any negative campaign against BBM will not work anymore. So let us use positive message against them. Let us use their 'hopes' and 'dreams' to set their expectations of what a brilliant leadership should be expected of BBM. 

Use his actual promises during the campaign. And remind people again and again, what a good leader he is if he can fulfill these absurd promises. 

Condition their mind to expect more and set high standards for BBM because he is different from the rest, he is the legendary leader we have been waiting for all these years. That tsunami of 31m votes!

At the same time, educate them what good governance looks like ---- under the great president Marcos Jr. Shape their minds to expect and demand more --- because he is the greatest president ever.

This way, when their expectations fall short --- they will be in for a slap of harsh truth, he is not as good as they thought after all. Their own machinery of propaganda will work against them especially under the challenges of weakened Philippine economy and cruel reality our world is in.

Worst case, he actually steps up lest people realize what an incompetent leader he truly is.

I already had a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/y047kl/the_saying_that_filipinos_have_no_originality_was/) regarding the issue but this is more of a Semi-Compiled and quick summary of what happened last month in October during the Gunpla Builders World Cup 2022 Philippines if you're already familiar I don't have to spill it out too much.

**For the uninitiated**

Gunpla Builders World Cup or GBWC is a yearly competition held by Bandai Co. Ltd for their line of Gunpla Model Kits, a line that has spanned at least 40 Years thanks to both Sunrise and Mobile Suit Gundam's continued success and it's considered chiefly as a test of Builder's building techniques to be shown around the world, due to Covid the past 2 years were mostly online submissions or were just put on hold

The Philippine's Venue was held in Robinson's Magnolia in Gilmore, Quezon City it was held from Sept 28-Oct 9 promoting upcoming releases and exclusives too along with the Witch from Mercury coming soon this was also the place where the entries were displayed.

**Episode 1: The Plagiarism and The Lies**On October 9 2022 the winner had been announced for the Over 21 Category, the image of the entry had a striking resemblance to the GBWC Entry from 2013 and keen observers noticed how blatant the plagiarism was

(Note these images were posted publicly by Bandai)

**Episode 2: Cursed Morality**

As this was found out by Filipino builders mostly found this many people had begun to criticize the builder and the group associated with them, they also criticized the Photographers and Judges for the former the way they took the shots was bad and the quality of the pictures given were plain awful, the contest still being checked using online polls even though physical judges were present

people were able to track down the studio behind the entry to be Hajime Modeling Studio [(They themselves publicly posted it)](https://imgur.com/W3w3IFv)

**Episode 3: Hajime's Pride**

When you win at something your Ego and Narcissism inflate, thinking you're the best there were some pictures leaked around about them blatantly admitting they copied and stole the idea, sadly not many remains of their comments albeit a few lucky screenshots as they each deleted them off of Facebook of their associates and even tries to call themselves a hypocrite unintentionally, I too was part of this but that doesn't matter as their mindset is still the same also I was calling them out as they had an associate account that posted the same thing but the account they used was for the Car Mods and Accessories business

[An example of ego](https://imgur.com/sBCdzDq)

[You can smell the Hypocrisy](https://imgur.com/hOWuml4)

[My Encounter](https://imgur.com/a/jyQD2dg)

**Episode 4: Unseen Consequences**

of course with any discourse people have called them out, but it wasn't enough as it had enough traction that even foreign builders began to take notice as well leading to further backlash clear [example](https://youtu.be/94j6pvJ52E0)

**Episode 5: No Reflection in an Icy Eye**

The controversy continued for about 4 weeks due to the fact another local builder who I follow on Twitter gave a brief summary of the situation it was just a day after the announcement but there was an ""Interesting?"" interaction between them and their associate.

[At this point they aren't the clowns anymore, they're the entire circus](https://imgur.com/VGMU9KB)

**Episode 6: An Ode to the end**

this part is just my personal view of what the hell just happened during these past 4 weeks, I haven't even started with what else happened with the other GBWC Events from other Countries, Singapore's was mostly filled with Funny Entries and at least that was the light at the end of the tunnel but this will be a lesson for future builders, judges, photographers just goes to show even with the pandemic something like this couldn't be held properly anymore and sadly it wasn't so nice for the other ones in the other countries refer to this [here](https://imgur.com/a/GFn0m2z)",1667805669.0

The Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 0.58% to 6,721 on Tuesday, paring big losses from earlier in the day but still closing at its lowest in nearly nine months, as investors assessed a landslide win in the presidential election by Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his potential economic policies. Analysts suggested that markets will wait for the new government to discuss its plan to spur growth, tame inflation and address the nation’s ballooning debt amid the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. Philippine stocks also tracked losses in global markets as rising US interest rates and slowing Chinese growth dampened investor sentiment. The mining & oil, property and services sectors performed worst in the local bourse. Losses in the benchmark index were led by Converge ICT (-5.3%), AC Energy (-5.3%), Robinsons Land (-4.1%), Wilcon Depot (-3.9%) and Globe Telecom (-3.8%).",1652172610.0

I am from Argentina and recently moved here to the Philippines to live with my girlfriend and have been in love with your country!  I have been honestly impressed by a lot of things in this country, economy, inflation rate, security, amongst other things.  And I love the presidential campaign and how emotional and invested everyone is about their favorite candidates for the election; However I do have some questions to better understand and would like to open a judge free discussion from both sides (BBM and Leni) To better understand the pros and cons of each candidate.. Unfortunately my Tagalog is still very basic, so I don't really understand much of what the news say haha.  Anyway, I have talked to a lot of people and it always seems like they just point at each other and call the opposite candidate bad and that's it but I wanna get more in depth as to why that is, so I have a few questions to better understand it all.

&#x200B;

What are each candidates posture on external and internal affairs?

&#x200B;

What are the economic plans to generate growth?

&#x200B;

Where do the candidates stand when it comes to education?

&#x200B;

What are their stance in infrastructure and development?

&#x200B;

How would each candidate manage crime and security?

&#x200B;

Just some questions I always think of when voting for president in my country, I hope both sides can voice their opinions and views without the need to flame or bully anyone so we can have a civil conversation!

[Leni:](https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/robredo-lacson-emerge-foreign-policy-ready-cnn-philippines-presidential-debate-2022/) Robredo underscored the need for the president to have both “vigilance and foresight” in anticipating the effects of war in Ukraine. She agreed with Lacson’s proposals, adding that taxes on fuel and power may also need to be reviewed in case of any emergency. The crisis should also prompt efforts to have the Philippines develop more local sources of electricity.

What will happen next in a Marcos presidency.,6,umnrji,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/umnrji/what_will_happen_next_in_a_marcos_presidency/,3,"I'm a Filipino that was raised abroad and moved to the Philippines a few years ago. My family have been diehard Marcos loyalist apologists from day 1. Most of the things I've heard from them about the reasoning for their support for this family is because they will help the Philippines with their ""Tallano Gold"" and usher in a golden era for Philippines. This is complete and utter nonsense and will never be the case. I think most of the common Filipinos have been flooded with propaganda and whitewashing that they will believe anything and do not know what will happen but only that we will have good times. So I've been talking to alot of other Filipinos that have studied politics and history in university and we predict that the Philippine economy is going to get very rough and probably will enter a period of stagflation. Here are a list of points that we believe will occur in a Marcos presidency and some of these you can already see are happening.  


1. Marcos will appoint cronies to high cabinet positions and enter a period of unmitigated graft. They will siphon off as much of the Philippine wealth the likes of which you have never seen. You think the Philhealth scandal was bad... wait just a little longer.
2. Confidence in PH economy will drop. Fewer foreign investors, migration of wealthier Filipinos to other countries, and the rising Filipino debt from Duterte's presidency will erode the trust from banks and cause the country to spiral into higher inflation. JP morgan just released a statement citing the election as a reason to view the Philippines as last  for foreign investment interest and is not recommended. This means that businesses will not want to work with the Philippines and could impact jobs and investments in country. 
3. The peso will fall in value. Because of rising inflation the value of the peso will drop. The FX of dollar to peso will drop. This will mean that price of commodities and value of goods will rise. The poorer Filipinos that have either fixed income from government or low income from work will be the hardest hit. The value of basic food items like rice will increase. 

I hope that I'm seeing this as just a worse case scenario and instead hope that BBM is so wildly inept that he doesn't screw up the economy too bad. That's the best case scenario. I sincerely hope instead we are wrong. Also, for those Filipinos that derive income from foreign work via online will probably be not hurt nearly as much because their income is tied to a currency outside of the Peso. I work online and get my income from USD therefore I'm a bit more insulated than other Filipinos. However, again with my point, the Filipinos who's income is tied to retirement, fixed income, or from work in country will feel the effect much more.",1652203068.0

[Serious] Reputable clinics/doctors that does breast reduction.,3,xtvkli,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/xtvkli/serious_reputable_clinicsdoctors_that_does_breast/,1,"Hi! I’ve been searching around the net but wasn’t able to get that much info about getting breast reduction here in the Philippines. There are too little reviews in the net for me to be able to make a decisions on where should I go. I’ve considered the Belo medical group but I wanted to have much more options. 

I’ve been having some serious eating disorders and body dysmorphia because of my big ol boobies. It really hard to look for clothes that will fit me and every time I try on dresses and clothes that I like I feel like there’s a big inflatable balloon in front of me. It took such a big blow to my self confidence knowing I can never freely dress without looking like an eyesore. I’ve also really hated it whenever someone points out their size, I feel so self conscious and bad about it. It also has been causing me back problems so I’ve been thinking for a long time to part with it. I just want to feel ok and comfortable in my own skin. 

Hoping you guys could help me~",1664734318.0

Dear Powers that be in PH - FIX INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL. The economy sort of depends on it right?,2,uxb0fw,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/uxb0fw/dear_powers_that_be_in_ph_fix_international/,2,"I just helped someone register with one health pass, and the entire time I am doing it for them I am thinking to myself *""It certainly is NOT more fun to GET INTO the Philippines...""*

Frankly, the system sucks. I have no idea what is happening in Thailand and other places where ""first world"" folks might want to go and spend money, what with many of our first world economies crashing and inflation biting us all hard.

Like... just why? And I am not one of these white folks who marries a Pinay and the complains about things all the time.

I love the PH, I cannot wait to go back. I stay in the wives barangay not at a hotel. It rocks.

But it seems that the harder it is for foreigners to get there, the less they want to go.

I am not rocket scientist, but the less they want to go, the less they DO go, and the less MONEY they spend right?

I mean, 21% of the ENTIRE economy is tourism. We live full time in Las Vegas, so we all get how important it is to get people coming back and spending money. 

Not to mention the OFWs that might go back home but WHAT A PAIN THIS IS. 

**Why though?**

I have been trying to figure this out instead of just complain. Here are some theories I had.

* Multi generational homes. Lots of spread of covid possible. Kids do not show symptoms but elders can be at risk more.
* Less than great hospital facilities. This is not ""racist"" it is just a thing that exists. Philippines has done a lot to make the system better, but it is what it is and overwhelming the system certainly would not help.
* Trying really hard to contact trace people - but contact tracing has been shown to be spotty. It worked well in Japan, poorly in the UK and USA, but who knows. Does it work in the PH?

Who knows. I just hope that the powers that be open up a little on things. Say what you will about Marcos Jr, but he at least in an interview publicly stated no more lockdowns, so that is good I guess.

Okay, that is just what i wanted to post on that. It was frustrating but we seem to have her in the queue for her QR code.

Wish us luck!",1653459375.0

"PH jobs grow, but inflation threatens recovery",2,wj9kmb,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/wj9kmb/ph_jobs_grow_but_inflation_threatens_recovery/,0,"[https://theworldreviews.com/ph-jobs-grow-but-inflation-threatens-recovery/](https://theworldreviews.com/ph-jobs-grow-but-inflation-threatens-recovery/) 

In June, there were more people working full-time, but the most recent jobs numbers indicate that rising prices are holding back the recovery of the labor market. This is the case despite the fact that there were more workers employed full-time.

The Philippine Statistics Authority reported on Monday, August 8, that the nation’s [underemployment rate,](https://www.theasianaffairs.com/why-indonesias-inflation-has-soared-to-a-7-year-high/) which refers to the proportion of those who are already employed but still want more work, decreased to 12.6 percent in June from 14.5 percent in May. This was a decrease from the previous month’s figure of 14.5 percent. This results in a decline of 780,000 people searching for more hours of work from the previous month’s total of 6.67 million to the subsequent month’s total of 5.89 million.

In comparison to June 2021, full-time employment, which is defined as working more than 40 hours per week, increased by 11 percent, which corresponds to an additional 3 million individuals. On the other hand, the number of people working part-time decreased by 8 percent, which corresponds to 1.4 million fewer individuals. The median number of hours put in at work increased from 39 in June 2021 to 40.3 the following year in June 2022.

The rate of visible underemployment, which is the proportion of people who are unemployed and work fewer than 40 hours per week, fell to 8.5 percent in June from 9.8 percent in May. This is a decrease of 0.2 percentage points.

The most recent findings reveal that there has been a considerable surge in the number of individuals who are employed full-time. According to Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan, **“while this is a good indication of the improving quality of work in our country, the government should incessantly boost its efforts towards providing an environment conducive to the creation of more and better employment opportunities.”**

In the meantime, the unemployment rate did not move from its previous level of 6% in the month of June. This equates to 2,99 million unemployed people in the Philippines.

When compared to the same month in 2021, the number of employed Filipinos in June 2022 increased by more than 1.5 million, bringing the overall number of employed Filipinos to 46.6 million.

## The threat of Inflation

Despite the fact that job numbers have been on the rise, there are signs that inflation is inhibiting the revival of the labor market.

The number of jobs in wholesale and retail trade experienced the largest decline, falling from 10.94 million in May to 9.72 million in June, a decrease of 1.2 million jobs.

According to the National Statistician, Dennis Mapa, there was a large loss of jobs in supermarkets and department stores (192,000), hardware stores (189,000), online or door-to-door sales, and other retail settings (144,000).

According to [Mapa’s findings](https://www.theasianaffairs.com/why-indonesias-inflation-has-soared-to-a-7-year-high/), decreases in employment were seen in both permanent and contractual situations.

According to Mapa’s analysis, **“these are the non-essential items, so my guess is that people were tightening their budgets and reducing their consumption, so it’s likely that’s why jobs in these sub sectors also declined. The way I assess it, these are the non-essential items that baka dahil nga siguro sa paghihigpit sa budget ay medyo bumawas ang consumption dito and that.”**

The rate of inflation shot up to 6.1 percent in June and then continued to climb in July, reaching 6.4 percent. This was mostly caused by price hikes for both food and transportation.

Additionally contributing to the rise in prices was the weak peso. Earlier, Mapa stated that one peso in 2018 would only be worth 0.87 pesos in June of 2022.  
**“In the near term, we will prioritize the immediate issues of rising inflation, the vulnerability of certain groups to shocks, and the pandemic-induced scarring to ensure that growth and employment gain are sustained,”** Balisacan said. **“This will ensure that growth and employment gain are maintained.”**",1659967208.0

Korean friend of mine expressed his understandable frustrations towards the current state of the ROK and the Philippines until he showed his true colors.,1,yk4c5r,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/yk4c5r/korean_friend_of_mine_expressed_his/,20,"Let's be honest; there are moments in our lives where we are so fed up with the current state of affairs, that we start to imagine ourselves as heads of state and government that will guide our nations to our liking. But we become to idealistic to the point where it becomes incredibly tempting to live by an ""ends-justify-the-means"" mentality and think this the world is a zero-sum game.

Korean Redditor friend of mine came to me on my Reddit DMs to express his frustrations towards the current state of his country and the Philippines. I understand because even if South Korea is in a far better position than the Philippines, things are looking terribly & horribly for both nations. 

But when he starts to talk to me about what he wants to do if he were president, things start to get incredibly disturbing. 

Here are his proposals if he were 

For education, he would make education mandatory with martial arts and combat mandatory in all school levels. He wants to train every single teacher regardless their specialization is math, science, social studies, arts, language, combat, sports, & technology like they are military drill instructors. He thinks children of the Philippines should have teachers like Terrence Fletcher from Whiplash or John Kreese from Cobra Kai as if it will improve the education standards of the state and society. 

For foreign policy, his is basically summed up as building trust and then throw them under the bus whenever shit hits the fan. Basically, he is not afraid to literally sacrifice the well-being of foreigners and treat them as disposable pawns for well-being of his own countrymen. He hates the guts of China, Japan, and the United States. He holds low regard for other countries like Taiwan, Vietnam, & Thailand as he views them as resources. He would like to sever all ties to China and Japan. I mean fuck the CCP and Nippon Kaigi for real, but how is he going to handle the economic fallout of cutting ties?

For economics, for the aforementioned economic fallout from cutting ties to China and Japan, he would basically beg America to fix their economy and set up factories their at all costs. He is also plans to report the currency of both Korea and the Philippines as 1.00 KRW = 1.00 USD; 1.00 = 1.00 USD. Also he plans to inflate the reported GDP. Basically, strong currency value, weak supply of goods. 

For energy, he just want to nuclearize the shit out of both the Philippines and South Korea. Also, he would ban private owned cars. Also bring windmills and hydroelectric and solar plants connected together but self sustaining on their own. 

For military, he would make military service mandatory for both men & women from ages 20-50. He is also wants a both countries to wield a minimum of 150 nuclear warheads with a self sustaining armed forces to back it up similar to that of Ukraine. 

For pop culture, he wants the Philippines to train its celebrities like they train their K-Pop Idols. He thinks that giving Filipino celebrities should be trained like they are in the military. To him, they should dance, sing, and act until they get injured. He absolutely despises Filipino showbiz. I agree, I hate the Filipino showbiz whether that is on TV or social media. He also wants to ban Facebook and make it punishable by death for accessing Facebook.

As for nationalism, he wants the Philippines to be take notes from Korean ethnonationalism despite the fact that the Philippines like India is a nation of hundreds of different ethnicities, cultures, tribes, and languages. 

No surprise he is a member of the South Korean ethnonationalist subreddit r/Hangukin.

He really thinks that a Cobra Kai mindset will help him lead either Korea or the Philippines to greatness. Not every aspect of our lives should not be like in the military.

Four of Cups reversed - suffering from apathy and tendency to ignore new opportunities, but there's a desire for a new start.

Three of Swords reversed - recovering from a loss or separation; signal to move forward; forgiveness (hmm...)

The Lovers - could be the Philippines, in short, *tayo*, noong eleksyon. Most of us chose BBM for president, SWOH as VP, etc. (intense eyeroll and sigh of disappointment). *Unity* raw. See how the guy's torso is made up of a card tower??? Tells me the guy is kinda weak. Up to you to decide who that guy symbolizes, and anyway nabanggit ko na yung interpretation ko so take that as a hint. Plus, look at the woman's dress. Pula. Huhu. (""Hindi pula't dilaw ang tunay na magkalaban,"" I know, but there you go.) And the phases of the moon within her makes me think of emotions (moon is related to emotional aspect of a person). Like most people who voted for you know who was driven more by emotional appeal than you know who's qualifications (which are almost nil, or on a very weak foundation - look at the card tower torso). Also, aminin na rin nating mga nasa kabilang kampo, naging mga emotional rin tayo noong election season. The moons also suggest cycles for me (like paulit-ulit ang moon phases) - it's like paulit-ulit na lang na ganito ang nagiging scenario pag eleksyon. 

Ang sad for a usually romantic(ized) card, no?

So, with the election results, even though the BBM-SWOH camp is espousing ""unity,"" weak ang foundations ng unity na ito, sadly. Or illusion lang siya ng unity. (You know very well kung bakit.)

Four of Cups reversed - so naging disappointing yung turnout ng elections for many of us who were against BBM to the point that some of us have become apathetic after that. Valid and understandable. And since it's reversed, it means we want a new start because obviously, the start of this administration has been really, really b a d. (I know, may mga external factors like inflation na nangyayari worldwide, but we have to admit the government right now isn't responding the way they *should*.)

Three of Swords reversed - yun na nga, naging devastating yung election results and many of us are still recovering from that (I am, too). Since reversed, signal siya na we need to move forward and gather the courage na bumangon ulit. Which I believe ginagawa na natin, although yes, the pain is still there, the anger, too. Baga, hindi siya moving on na as if ""okay lang"" na nanalo yung taong hindi naman qualified mamuno in the first place--moving on in a way na we're rebuilding ourselves in the process. It also signals forgiveness, but maybe in our case it's more of forgiving ourselves. Maybe we were asking ourselves kung saan tayo nagkamali at ganito nangyayari sa paligid natin. We know better this time, and we can leverage the pain and bitterness to rebuild ourselves and help the country rebuild in the process. :')

Thoughts?

Hindi pa nakakarecover from the pandemic ang Pilipinas at most probably uutang siyang muli kasi mahina pa ang ekonomiya kailangan bombahan ng investments.

Andaming external factors na hindi niya kayang macontrol. Global supply chain crisis at skyrocketing prices of petroleum dahil sa gera na nag pupush sa inflation ng matindi satin. May epekto rin ito sa local food supply natin dahil magmamahal ng fertilizer, gas pang transpo ng produkto, at regular na konsumo ng mga working class. Gut issues ang primary concern ng mga botante. Hindi niya madedeliver agad agad ang mga naipangako niya.

Looming political threat ng mga Duterte. Nanalo si Blengblong hindi lang dahil siya ay Marcos. Nanalo si Blengbong dahil sa boto ng mga DDS thru Sara. Hindi sila bestfriends. Political alliance lang yan. Any sign of weakness sasaksakin siya ng kampo ni Duterte sa likod. Ang potensyal na pagkapanalo ni Blengblong ay dahil sa high trust rating ng botante sa mga Duterte.

Parang mga pating lang tayong mga nasa People's Campaign na nagaabang ng bawat mali ni Blengblong. Kung tinira nila ng 6 na taon si VP Leni, gagantihan natin naman sila ngayon. Nabuhayan na ng loob ang kabataan at araw-araw magmamasid yan at magaamplify ng kabulastugan ni Blengblong.

Is FEM really smart? An explanation for the current monetary system,0,u2xin6,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/u2xin6/is_fem_really_smart_an_explanation_for_the/,14,"Did FEM make the smartest move to borrowing fiat during his era? Does he know that money will be inflated and does the true cost of borrowed money will be less in the future?

I just got into crypto and made researched the reason why it was made in the first place. It's made to be decentralized and finite, why? Because the current fiat (dollar) currency is unlimited and can be frozen by banks ( who do run the by the few). Let's go to the history:

1971- US abandoned Gold Standard. The so-called reserve currency does no longer backed by gold, which was tested through time to be the most valuable asset.

1972- Martial Law started due to the threat of a communist takeover. Or, it was really made to be this way. Thus, Marcos started borrowing money for building the Philippines (and himself too).

By 1980, debt climbed to $17.2 billion. That sounds like a lot, yeah, but we know the infrastructures that were built that until now are heavily used. Was this a smart move? **DEFINITELY, YES**. As long as the Filipinos are using these (even so-called debt-driven economy).

Let's now shift to the current monetary system and how it works. Through time, Gold and Silver were used to trade goods, however, it does get inflated by the kings/emperors who mixed other raw materials to generate more amounts (ex. 80% silver, 20% copper). Thus, silver or gold no longer have the same value as 100% purity. In 1971 when the US abandoned the gold standard, where does the said fiat-backed? **NONE.** It was backed by pure faith that the system will work (government and military).

40 years later, we're now suffering from the effect of the current money backed by **nothing**. We were taught about the cause of inflation, supply and demand, however, it was not heavily reiterated by the colleges (who do run by the few) the effect of printing unlimited money supply. Why do they print endlessly? Because they do so. Henceforth, all prices will just simply go up

We have backed our faith in the current monetary system that they'll not print money, however, they did. This happened during the 2008 and 2020 crashes. Alarmingly, 80% of US dollar supplies have been printed in 2021 alone. With this, the said amount of debt is greatly depreciated in actual value.

Now, did FEM really know about this and purposely borrowed money as it is **fake money,** and does the value depreciates? What if all the infrastructures were made and believed that Filipinos will able to pay for this as we're one of the most smartest and hard-working people on the planet?",1649876082.0

So you're saying the dollar is worthless because it's a fiat currency? Thus, Marcos ""played"" the world by borrowing fake money?  
First, fiat currencies are backed by governments. They rely on the faith that the governments can back it up.   
On the other hand, cryptocurrencies are backed by the belief that other people see their value. It's unregulated, and almost anyone can start a new cryptocurrency. As a result, crypto is very prone to pump and dumps. Most crypto enthusiasts and influencers are quickly devolving into MLM recruiters.  
There's a difference between having faith in a government and having faith in MLM wannabes. The bottom line is that Marcos played us. He borrowed a lot of money and pocketed most of it, leaving us to pay it decades later.",1649876082.0

Wouldn't our debt be worse if the USD is still backed by gold? If the economy grows, but the amount of currency circulating does not, then the currency's value rises to the detriment of anyone holding debt.

Imagine if Duterte Borrowed Bitcoin at the start of the Pandemic (was ~200k PHP at that time). That means he would be paying ~2 MILLION PHP per unpaid Bitcoin right now. How is that smart?

>By 1980, debt climbed to $17.2 billion. That sounds like a lot, yeah, but we know the infrastructures that were built that until now are heavily used. Was this a smart move? DEFINITELY, YES. As long as the Filipinos are using these (even so-called debt-driven economy).

It's a smart move... as long as you ignore that a lot of those debt was not used on infrastructure, and instead used in enriching themselves and their cronies.

From COVID-19, we rallied and didn't support the president strengthening lockdowns because it would hurt the economy, but we rallied and trended ""OustDuterte"" when he was reducing lockdowns to save the economy?  


Edit: I forgot to mention how we've bashed the lockdowns and government response based on inaccurate data to forward a political agenda (Which is measuring severity of COVID in our country by total number of cases and not by per capita cases/deaths/etc).  


(Also, on the dolomite beach project, though I might get hate for supporting it, it's a way for government to give jobs by public works when we're in a recession so I don't understand the hate for this.)

Also, on the topic of inflation, I think it's unfair to put that burden on the administration since inflation is a global problem because of restricted supply and large demand (Caused by lockdowns and quarantine) and a transition from restricted supply to slow producing supply compared to large demand would cause immediate inflation. Democratic Socialist countries in Europe had a high inflation rate, same for the US, same for Japan & Korea, which then applies to the Philippines.

Im telling you that the COVID response was botched up. They could have done a million things to respond to the pandemic properly. 


1. Proper contact tracing- seryoso, this was the part that really ticked me off. The people in charge of the DOH hotlines were........POLICEMEN. For contact tracing call centers at least they got school nurses. Pero dapat ang school nurses na lang nilagay nila sa DOH Hotlines kasi mas importante yun sa patient management, patient transfer and hand over. If contact tracing, sige assign mo ang police. BUT THEY HAD SO FEW PEOPLE to do contact tracing. Contact tracing was a fucking joke. The follow ups were jokes, even tracing positives were a joke. And their excuse.....kulang daw sa manpower. Sana nilagay na lang nila yung napakaraming call center agents na nawalan ng trabaho sa contact tracing. Madali lang ang contact tracing, they can give it to non HCW and laymen....meanwhile sa DOH One hospital command ang pulis. 😐


2. Faceshields and copper masks, shitty meds that don't work (Ivermectim). Seryoso, WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY that required its citizens to use faceshields outside. I mean what the fuck talaga. Copper masks that never worked that had a hole below it and was advertised by Duterte propagandists on billboards. Doctors already calling out against faceshields, copper masks, and even against the use of Ivermectin and these pieces of shit sold them just to make money. 


3. Shitty equipment. The first batches of PPE from China were made of extremely warm plastic. Move your hip up a bit and you'll find a gigantic hole up your ass. The KN95s from China.....some of them were not even medical grade and were defective. Wear them and one of the strings will go off in the middle of intubation. 


4. Wrong timing of lockdowns, wrong timing of closing borders, wrong timing of reopening. Healthcare personnel have called for border closures and flight cancellations as early as December. Did they listen? NO, we must appease China daw pucha. We called for early lockdowns, again they did not listen. They announced that they will reopen....in the middle of a rising spike in cases. 


I can tell you so many more stuff. Hell I can even dish some shit out on Marcos' handling of inflation. 


Sure we have COVID, Sure we have global economic recession....BUT OUR LEADERS COULD HAVE DONE MORE, Could have listened more, and could have cared more


Mahiya naman sila that the community pantry did so much good compared to what they did during the pandemic. 


Fuck you Duterte, fuck you Marcos. Lalo ka na Marcos, magdodonate ka na lang ng equipment kung kelan tapos na pandemic, may sticker mo pang hayop ka. Buti pa yung isa dyan, nagdodonate pero walang pangalan, walang sticker, walang camera, from start of pandemic to finish.",1665410523.0

The problem with this view is that it treats COVID response as a binary thing where it was either Duterte's specific way of handling it, or not.

The lockdowns, per Duterte's implementation, were not good _because there was little-to-no financial aid to go along with it_. You can't tell people to stay indoors for a month, while also refusing to provide them with funding that would allow them to abide by the decree. This is not to say that therefore we shouldn't have done the lockdowns at all, but rather that there was a better way to do the lockdowns.

And then, even when the Duterte administration actually WAS implementing a lockdown, it frequently did so too late to respond to growing cases, as with the Delta wave in 2021, or that it didn't implement one at all in response to Omicron in Jan/Feb of this year.

Combine that with issues such as their mishandling of people going back to the provinces from the cities, and the DOH's refusal to acknowledge COVID as an airborne virus (which informs the specifics of how COVID restrictions were [badly] implemented, ergo indoor gatherings and so on), and the DOH's missteps in vaccine procurement, and the broader point is that it's very possible to think that Duterte's COVID response was flawed, *even if one also thinks that public health restrictions are a necessary part of combating a pandemic*.

It really wasn't very many jobs, if at all. A programme to significantly eat into unemployment via public works would look vastly different from creating the dolomite beach.

The administration did not _cause_ inflation, yes.

The administration is still responsible for _what they are doing in response to inflation_.
