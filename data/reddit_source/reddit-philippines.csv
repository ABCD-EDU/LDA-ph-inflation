Your Primer on Inflation and Currencies,394,xq7iwf,phinvest,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/xq7iwf/your_primer_on_inflation_and_currencies/,88,"I'll just do a thought dump on these two topics here.

**What is inflation?**

Text-book definition is it's the general increase of price of goods and services. Yun bubblegum mo na piso dati ngayon dalawang piso na? Bingo. Inflation is a natural occurrence in market economies. You'd hate to have the opposite because it's a *trap* (insert meme here)

**Is all inflation between countries the same?**

From a country-to-country basis, no. For example, food is the biggest weighting to Philippine inflation figures with nearly 40%. If food costs troop upwards, Philippine inflation will likely move similarly. This is in contrary to Singapore where food has a smaller weighting to their inflation figures.

**Is inflation a problem?**

It depends on who you ask. Ideally, you want inflation to be low and consistent. If less than ideal, you just want it to be consistent. You definitely don't want any negative inflation -- that is why Japan welcomes all forms of inflation. You also don't want inflation to be low as a result of low domestic demand; that's what China is currently facing as the *odd* benefit of their ongoing real-estate crisis and strict COVID policy is dampening demand and ironically keeping inflation low during a time where most developed nations are struggling with it.

**Can I protect against inflation by switching PHP to <insert currency>?**

You're not comparing apples to apples. Inflation is the increase on the prices of goods and services; it doesn't affect your currency. One peso is *still* one peso -- it's just that the purchasing power of the peso changes. You need to understand that if you put 10-pesos in the bank today, it's still 10-pesos in 2023. Many people in phinvest have this misconception na nagiging 8 or 9, trust me, your 10 remains a 10 unless may nagnanakaw sayo; it's just that you can buy less products with it. Knowing the difference of this concept is incredibly important for those learning economics.

**Why isn't the BSP moving to strengthen the Peso?**

The BSP generally adopts a hands-off approach and just lets the peso float in the free market. However, it intervenes from time to time (like recently) as it sells its dollars and buys pesos in the market to stabilize it. However, this is a short-term solution for volatility. Right now, we're in the middle of the pack. The peso isn't weak, it's just that the dollar is strong.

It has always moved cautiously because you don't want to be the next Venezuela. If the BSP aggressively hikes to strengthen the peso, what it'll likely do is stifle growth within the country and this furthermore leads to the road to Argentina. Gusto niyo ba car loans niyo mag +50%? Thought so.

**Pangit ba if mataas ang USD/PHP?**

In general, yes. Because the Philippines imports more than its exports since 2010. However, running a negative trade balance isn't always bad. For example, the US has been running a deficit for a very long time. If you're still confused, read up on international trade because it'll be a long topic.

What a rising dollar means is that it's unfavorable for imports and favorable for exports. The pendulum can swing at any time (e.g. USD/PHP at 40s during 2008) and one isn't necessarily better than the other; maybe it's time to improve our export industry by reviving the manufacturing base as Filipino products are getting more competitive versus the dollar. **What's important is the relative stability of the PHP.** Hindi yun 40 today, 60 tomorrow. Businesses cannot function when forex markets are extremely volatile (they'll likely just close stores if they do). But a gradual increase or decrease is fine because it doesn't shit on their decision making.

**Pangit ba if malakas ang Peso?**

Like I said, it depends on where you are sa export/import balance. If you're an OFW, you'd hate it because you're suddenly remitting less pesos than you're used to. If you're like Japan in the 1980s, it's the downfall of your economy.

>Case study: In the 1980s, Japan's economy was booming. It's the #2 economy behind the United States as its exporting a lot of Toyota, Fujitsu, Panasonic, name it. From Y240 in 1985, it appreciated so much that by 1995 it hit Y80. At its peak, it temporarily made Japan's economy nearly the same size of the US but it hurt export growth and the industrial base so much that Japan never really recovered their number two spot ceding it to China (it now grapples with deflation throughout much of the 2000s).  
>  
>Case Study #2: Ironically, China learned from this and intentionally made the Yuan undervalued versus the USD throughout most of its economic growth cycle. It does this by buying US currency and treasury notes in the market and this is also why they have massive foreign reserves.  
>  
>The cheap Yuan gives China an unfair advantage in the export market and couple this with their manufacturing base means the rise of China to be the number-two economy through ""Made in China""

**I moved from PHP to USD/EUR/GBP, what do I need to know?**

First of all, you lost a bit as the money changer got a bit of their share in your spread. So, all things considered, you already lost money. Since you switched currencies, you're now exposed to *that* currency and everything that affects it.

**Is it okay to hate inflation but like rising wages?**

Well, *no*. You see, not only does the increase of raw materials affect inflation but also rising wages. All else equal, if wages rise and there's one banana left in the supermarket, and you really want to go all-in monkey today -- you'll do a bidding war for that banana. That's how US inflation happened as they gave out stimulus cheques during COVID to prop up the economy. 

**USDPHP, san ka punta, to da moon.**

USDPHP will be favorable short-term but tapers off long-term. This is because the DXY is already at an all-time high with levels not seen since 2002. The US Federal Reserve is hiking rates to tame inflation, but they can only do this as long as employment is high in the US. If the labor market cools, it's expected to let off the gas pedal. The BSP will likely just follow the Fed much like the rest of the central banks of the world. If they hike, we hike. There's only few that resists this trend such as Japan's BoJ or China's PBoC.

If you ask me, I'd say short-term it'll peak at P62-P63. But medium-long, I'd say an average of P55 is likely. If you want to believe UBS (min. P150M in the bank), then they're sticking with P60 as peak. The more you expect a recession to come, the faster you should expect it to cool.

**Marcos Golden Era here we go.**

Please, bumalik ka na sa r/philippines kasi nakakabobo nitong statement. Don't attempt subjective politicking in phinvest. Our current predicament is inherited. We inherit our 2022 budget, our trade balance, and even our dollar reserves. Even if Leni wins, you'd be faced with the same headwinds as Marcos. Heck, it's likely same lang nga economic team nila regardless of who sits in Malacanang. I don't see Diokno being replaced anytime soon.

Your Primer on Inflation and Currencies,389,xq7iwf,phinvest,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/xq7iwf/your_primer_on_inflation_and_currencies/,88,"**What about the Russia-Ukraine War? Ano implications?**

Well, generally the world hates war. So right off the bat meron ka na agad uncertainties sa market. Everytime Putin spooks the world by threatening to launch nukes, expect the S&P500 to be in the red.

In a nutshell, the war heightened geopolitical risks and..

* decreased world gdp - because it's wartime
* increased world inflation - thanks to soaring food commodity prices
* lowered consumer confidence - it's wartime...
* boosted the dollar further - it's a flight for safety
* raised oil prices significantly - because Russia is a major oil player
* raised commodity prices significantly - Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat (bread, etc.) for example
* and depressed stock prices - it's wartime for god sake's

So, does war increase inflation? Yes. Does it increase the USD strength? Yes. Not only because people have a tendency to choose safer assets (e.g. the US Dollar) but also because inflation will drive up interest rates hand-in-hand.

This will be a *heavy* problem for Europe. As winter approaches and the apparent shortage of gas, many will face a choice of being warm and hungry or being cold and content. An energy crisis spares nobody -- industrials will also suffer as they'll be forced to shut down as energy gets redirected to the populace in the worse case.",1664355679.0

Commodities is the top answer on top of my head. Because remember that inflation is the rise of goods and not your currency. This can be anywhere from wheat products to tangible assets like gold.

**What about real estate in inflationary environment?**

This one is a bit of a mixed bag. From an asset perspective, land just keeps up with inflation so it's a good inflation hedge. Problem is, central banks tend to hike rates if inflation rises too much, and this dampens demand for real estate causing real estate prices to fall.

"Hyperinflation, ""Fear-Mongering"", and the Nations of Sri Lanka and Venezuela - an analysis",310,vafn7i,phinvest,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/vafn7i/hyperinflation_fearmongering_and_the_nations_of/,107,"Tl;dr - A like-to-like scenario of what is happening in Venezuela and Sri Lanka is unlikely, but there *is* cause for concern.

First, let's provide context on the main countries discussed and how they came to be where they are - Venezuela and Sri Lanka

***Hyperinflation in Venezuela***

Venezuela is considered a ""banana republic"", or a nation that is dependent on one primary resource export. In the case of Venezuela, it is oil. The annexation of Crimea back in 2014 created a geopolitical landscape that generated a huge surplus of oil in the world market, which brought the price per barrel down in the 2010s. However, due to Venezuela's over reliance on its oil export (most of its social programmes are funded by oil) and the crashing of the barrel price, their economy crashed which caused them to take on more and more debt, which soon became the resulting hyperinflation (up to 1,000,000%).

***Hyperinflation in Sri Lanka***

Sri Lanka is a tiny nation of 21 million people. Because of this, they are reliant on imports for a lot of things in their country. The current pandemic made a huge dent on the economy of Sri Lanka, a country reliant on tourism, which exacerbated an already weak economy due to their president cutting Sri Lanka's VAT by half (less tax = less government money) and the push for organic crops which reduced their agriculture yield, another primary export. Because Sri Lanka can no longer guarantee payment, imports like fuel are now restricted for the country, resulting in rolling power cuts and cutting off the livelihood of a lot of Sri Lankans.

***Why hyperinflation is unlikely to happen in the Philippines?***

We can consolidate the reasons into three main points:

1) Competent Department of Finance appointees by BBM - Benjamin Diokno is an experienced appointment that has served under multiple administrations, including Cory Aquino and Duterte. There is also the added benefit of continuity from the previous admin to the current one, continuing the trend of competent finance secreatry appointments (like Duterte's Carlos Dominguez)

2) Unlike Venezuela, we are not overly reliant on one primary export (96% of Venezuela's exports relied on oil production) and unlike Sri Lanka, we are a much larger nation both in size and in GDP. A like to like scenario of the occurences in these countries are already unlikely due to this nature.

3) The hyperinflation of these countries occured because the world bank lost confidence in the said country's abilities to pay back loans. BBM will be inheriting a positive Philippine GDP growth in his presidency, amounting to 8.3% growth (Duterte, in comparison, inherited 6.8% GDP growth) and the effects of improving infrastructure under the build build build program.

***So are claims of ""fear-mongering"" regarding hyperinflation true?***

The reason I made this post is due to the increasing number of posts on this sub with regards to ""fear-mongering"", comparing our situation with the nations of Venezuela and Sri Lanka. There is truth to this - the situation in Venezuela and Sri Lanka is unlike the one we have here in the Philippines. However, I also found that the answers given in these threads to be dismissive and not at all constructive. Regardless of your political leanings, there *is* reason to be worried about the future of the Philippine economy.

1) Debt under the Duterte administration ballooned to 11.7 trillion under his administration. Diokno highlights however that they are medium to long term debt, maturing in reasonable 25 to 40 years for the country. However, we will need to sustain a consistent 6-7% growth over the next six years in order to lower our gdp-to-debt ratio. As of this moment, that number for the Philippines is 60.5%

2) The War in Ukraine and the effects of the pandemic has triggered a high rate of inflation across the entire world. BBM will be inheriting a much more challenging economic landscape during his presidency, in comparison to what Duterte inherited underneath the Aquino administration

3) Our GDP is still overly reliant to the service sector, making up 60% of the country's GDP. 10% of the Philippines GDP comes from remittances. We import way more than we export, and what we do export (agriculture and various electronic products) lags behind our regional cousins, like Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam.

4) Perhaps the most egregious worry, however, and one we share in common with both Venezuela and Sri Lanka, is rampant corruption. One of the main reasons that Venezuela and Sri Lanka are where they are now is due to the vehement thievery of their leaders from the taxes of the people, and the incompetency that got them to where they are. Both the Rajapaksa's and Chavez / Maduro are accused of siphoning billions of dollars from their banks in order to be laundered to banks outside of their countries. Taxes that were supposed to fund infrastructure on both countries were pocketed, while they continue to run off platforms of populism that appealed to the uneducated masses.

One must also come to understand that the situations in the said countries did not happen overnight. The situation in Venezuela has just been a continuation of the troubles the country faced under the Chavez administration from 2002, and Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a continuing arm of a corrupt political dynasty that has been in power since 2005. We may not be in the situation that they are in at the moment, but to dismiss claims of worry from people is ignorant at best, and harmful at the worst. The chances of hyperinflation of the scale of what is happening in Sri Lanka and Venezuela are unlikely to happen, however the image of a worrying Filipino economical landscape is likelier than some people might claim it to be. The fact of the matter is is that the Philippines has chosen who it wants to be lead by, and that is no longer something we can change. What we can control, however, is doing our due diligence with regards to the information that we consume and disseminate, which I think we should hold ourselves as good investors to.

Those are not valid apples-to-apples comparison. 

That 8.3% is just a base effect and the PHL is only hitting its pre-pandemic GDP levels this year. Yes, it is higher growth pero hello the PHL had a negative growth of -9.5% in 2020. SUPER MALI YAN. 

The buffer provided by strong economy is no longer present with the incoming Marcos Jr presidency. 

Target is to have 6% to 7% GDP growth rate annually to bring down the above 60% debt-to-GDP ratio but you have to ask yourself where will the GDP growth come from. Ang daming nasa services industry--hotel, tourism, restaurant ang nagsara permanently (this is called economic scarring).

Govt cannot afford to maintain its 5% infra spending on its own coz pataas na ang interest rates--cost of borrowings is now rising and wala ng fiscal space. Ang daming entitlements na pinasa ni Duterte--free college education, free irrigation, higher salaries and consequently pension for military and police, i.e. funding requirement is now at PhP 5.7 trillion at minimum, higher salaries until 2023 for the rest of govt workers, na MAHIRAP i-cut down. 

Will private sector be ready to enter the infra sector again thru Public-Private Partnerships? Maybe, maybe not. It depends on the terms of the PPPs. Hindi ba opportunity uli yan para sa mga cronies ni Marcos Jr. 

I TOTALLY AGREE THOUGH THAT HYPERINFLATION IS A FAR-FETCHED SCENARIO FOR NOW. But the opportunity for abuse is there. Under BSP's new charter, it can now lend money again to the national government as what Duterte resorted to at height of pandemic. 

You also have a president who has a baggage amounting to PhP 203 Billion in tax liabilities, sequestered assets that are still subject to litigation, and maybe other assets he wants to recover for his family.

You think he would waste his 6 years in office at minimum to not expend political capital in getting those assets back. Will he do the right thing by passing new taxes, cutting on non-essential spending at risk of losing his popularity when he wants to prove that he deserves his return to Malacanang. 

And you think that 5% infra spending is just not wasted funds. Why is it that less than 20 lang ang high-impact projects under Build, Build, Build ang natapos? Mostly ang 5% na infra spending na yan eh mga flood control projects, local roads, local school buildings kung san malaki ang chance na magka-commission ang mga pulitiko. 

I dont like fear mongering but you only have to look at the experience of a country like Turkey to see it is easy to lose 30 years of hard-won economic gains once it began embracing a autocrat. In their case, it is Erdogan for more than 10 years. In our case, the PHL slide began under Duterte and now it will likely continue under Marcos. 

Sabi nga ni Prof Monsod, the Dictator Father also had the best cabinet secretaries then--Sicat, Virata, but the PHL still had to suffer its deepest economic recession post-World War 2. 

My gut feel is that Marcos is just using the ""shine"" afforded by the technocrats in his cabinet so he will have enough leeway to win over the confidence of the international markets and business community until he is finally 100% sure of his hold in office before he starts on his ""vindictive"", changing of history mode. 

The last thing he needs right now is further peso depreciation due to falling investor confidence which will lead to higher inflation.",1655013963.0

They are literally Bankrupt. Sri Lanka’s GDP is $84b, foreign debt of $51.72b (61.57% of GDP) and only $3..1b on foreign reserves as of Dec 2021. In comparison, the Philippines’ GDP is at $361b, foreign debt of $105.93b (28.51% of GDP) and $108.05b of foreign reserves. It is clear that the financials of the country is on healthy, i would say. We wont be seeing any economic crisis anytime soon unless something bad happens (war, bubble, aliens, etc)

So in our case, we can see if our foreign reserves are slowly depleting the following years, if yes, the government should do something about it. But one reason why we are more stable than sri lanka is bacuse of the stable influx of foreign reserves from OFW and BPO.

I give it 20% chance na magkaroon ng economic crisis in the next 6 years.

The only bad thing im seeing with our current economic status is our lower export compared to import, basically a trade deficit. Its not yet at alarming levels imo, but it is something that the next administration should focus. we lack in local production of goods, our imports will only increase years on after this pandemic as filipinos consume more and more commodities up to the point where we will start to rely on imports and we will be vulnerable to any global crisis. No Philippine president ever has looked into directing the country to be an export economy, most of their taglines mostly include “iaangat ang nasa laylayan” or “iaahos sa kahirapan” or any usual taglines that mentions the poor there is nothing wrong with that, what is wrong for me is, they so fixated in the poor that they loose focus on the bigger picture.  they may be able to strengthen our industrial sector, as this will be the backbone of our economy.

Read up on economic history, learn about what happened during recessions and evaluate whether you are prepared for that. If not then start preparing! Things like checking how your company is doing, would your sector be affected and how much, what sectors would be in demand during a recession, maybe you have to either postpone or expedite some of your plans in life because of this, etc etc.

Whether or not we agree with the inflation rate published by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), we can all agree that inflation now is ridiculous. Whereas before our Php 5,000 can afford us 2 or 3 carts full of groceries, the Php 5,000 now can barely fill up a cart. One peso in 2018 is worth a mere 87 centavos today. 

Aside from putting our savings in banks offering rates higher than the inflation rate, what tips can you share to stretch your Peso and survive these trying times?  


Instead of buying fresh produce from the grocery, buy from the palengke.

Instead of filling up your vehicle with the most expensive fuel variant, downgrade to the basic and cheaper variants. If you can, just bring a bike (or take public transportation) to the office instead of a vehicle.

Adjusting your consumption is the biggest thing. Since your buying power is lower, your consumption should also adjust to reflect that. This is the time when your ability to discern your needs versus wants would really shine.
2. Reduce your credit card debt. Since credit card interest rates will be going up, do not be stuck paying high interest rates on your debts. High debt will further decrease your buying power. Check all your other debts. Variable rates should be prioritized. Fixed rate interests are good since inflation will pay off that debt for you.
3. Buy local. Weak peso means all imported goods are more expensive. Patronizing local also means we help our country reduce the effect of recession (reduce lang kasi inevitable ang recession).

&#x200B;

1. We are on IF 16/8 2 meals a day from 12-6PM meal window.
2. We cook our food.
3. I have a car, but I choose to use public transpo. Huwag lang sasabay sa peak hours.
4. If it's 5km or less, I walk. 
5. Antay ng SALE at least 20%, better if 50% up, then store. Landers and S&R (or the likes) have so many discounted items from time to time.
6. Buy fruits and vegetables from bagsakan and store it. Mall prices are 3-10x more expensive.   
7. Buy seafoods sa mga bagsakan and store it. Mall prices are 3-10x more expensive.
8. From above 6 & 7, better if you buy kapag malapit na magsara dahil bagsak presyo na siya. For example, a regular PHP40/kg na kamatis, i-bargain nila to 10-20 pesos nalang. Or if you can store more, meron per karton, sobrang mas mura parang halos 5-10 pesos nalang per kilo.
9. If you're living in a tight space like condo, try vertical gardens (or hydroponics) kahit lettuce, tomatoes, petchay, and some herbs lang ok na.
10. Open the window kung malamig (at malinis) ang hangin.
11. Natural light helps save electricity. Open the window or any window treatment.
12. Lower the brightness/backlight of your TV if you have. You can also watch with lights off.
13. If you're working from home with your laptop, set the battery saver on (unless may demand for high perf). Then remove the plug when your battery is at 100%. Some charger consumes as much as 200W+, that's 2KW in 10 hours.
14. Unplugged unused electronics. They still consume up to 25% of their rated wattage.
15. If you use your internet for personal or up to 5 people, you can downgrade to 50mbps or less. That's enough. (some may disagree, depending on their need)
16. Use a shower head with aerator. It consumes less water because of the air-water mixture.
17. Use highly efficient devices (inverters).
18. If you can buy a front-load washer, buy. It's more efficient and consumes less water.
19. If you're heavy on call and text, buy basic phone with more than a week bat-life.
20. Take care of your health, as hospitalization in our country is expensive, and can drain even an upper middle class.
21. Eating less yet nutritious food (you save more and healthier at the same time).
22. Exercise. Not in a gym but making use of your energy in efficient way. Kapag walking distance ang pupuntahan, maglakad. Kung malapit yung grocery, maglakad. Instead of electronic cleaners, try manual. Wash your car, wax and buff it. 
23. If you're less than 30 years old, avoid girlfriends/boyfriends. It drains your money, energy (both mental, emotional, and physical), and time. Have one when you're ready to marry.
24. No high maintenance pets.
25. Maghanap ng kahati sa Netflix since up to 5 users naman.
26. No spotify (or other audio services) premium (unless audiophile ka), if it's for casual listening, YT is enough.
27. Kapag lumalabas kami para mamasyal, nagbabaon kami ng lutong bahay. There are parks that you can eat your meal sa mga upuan at mesa within the perimeter (i.e. BGC)
28. ..and the list goes on. So many alternative ways.

buy less meat. most of our protein comes from animals, but plants have protein too and getting more protein from plants may be healthier. oatmeal and peanut butter for lunch might not be as good as 2pcs of chicken joy and rice but it is more nutricious.

learn to calorie count and intemittent fasting. i realized im eating more than i really need to when i learned to meal prep and calorie count.  its too easy to overeat when just eyeballing portions. this probably the biggest factor in saving me money for groceries.

Because,

People tend to forget but **inflation differs** its impact depending on what you consume and the CPI changes for that category. Iba ang inflation ng Philippines sa inflation ng Singapore. For example, **the biggest driver of Philippine inflation is food as it is 45%** of the CPI basket. On the other hand, **food merely contributes 20% of Singapore's inflation** ^((they're approximate figures guys.. don't be too anal about the figures)).

It is always cheaper to eat home cooked meals with ingredients from palengke

I found a palengke vendor who serves as my personal shopper to collect my orders on my behalf then lalamove it to my home. Lalamove alone is cheaper than 1L of fuel and I do not spend time, money or any effort to get the orders.

3. Try to walk. Not only it will save you money, it will also do good for your health. The gas prices have increased thus the fare. I just wish the government would make sidewalks safer and walkable (I doubt because clearly they don’t care about us).

4. Avoid scrolling on shopee, lazada, tiktok budols. You’ll think you need the items but you don’t.

5. Try to eat 3x a day and have snacks in between (fruits if possible) so you would avoid cravings for milkteas, jollibee, etc.

6. Cook your own food. Magbaon ng pagkain sa office so you dont have to buy.

7. Take vitamins and good care of yourself. Health care is so soooo expensive.

8. Instead of paying netflix subscription, I watch on Loklok app. Kapag wala sa Loklok, I try other sites.

this is more generic than specific to region and anecdotal.

1. Minimalist lifestyle;
2. Live minimalist;
3. Minmalist lifestyle does not mean cheap, stingy.
4. Minimalist lifestyle = selecting what's more valuable, not being part of consumerism.---------Food - is my greatest enemy. there are always alternative, but not stingy. Learn substitutes.Transport - I have a car, but my daughter drives it, so indirectly it showed me public transport works! I walk and take a bus, buying a pushbike is an upgrade!Housing - I live in a shared house. I don't rent a whole apartment/house. I rent a room. So I'm paying half of what it normally cost.

From my experiences over time, since divorce. I have to live minimalist lifestyle. I've been there, living cheap, stingy -- before realising, it's not about being cheap or stingy, but rather know what's more valuable and avoid the temptation of consumerism.

It's easy to consume. Two dollars here, five dollars there, next thing you know in two weeks you just spend $150.......

1. If your a family of 2-4 buy wholesale chicken in the palengke not choice cuts. A whole chicken can be cooked to different menu e.i. wings and drumsticks as fried chicken, breasts and neck as adobo or tinola. Stretching it to two meals than one. 
2. If have space plant your own veggies, malunggay, okra, sayote, papaya and such. Doing this since pandemic started and never regretted my decision. 
3. Buy crack eggs, it is much cheaper though must be consumed within a day or two. 
4. If you have a vehicle, remove unnecessary items to lessen weight and that includes gas tank. Better to run half full for better efficiency.

\---

*Quick commentary: Wanted to post this piece here 2 weeks ago but something happened and it got delayed. I then saw a couple of real estate posts*[*^(1)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/xan382/need_help_with_house_options/)*^(,)*[*^(2)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/xaiy6m/mortgage/)*^(,)*[*^(3)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/xaemsi/want_to_build_a_house_is_it_possible/) *in the past few hours (*[*specially the one about the 10% mortgage rate*](https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/xah2ek/10_pa_mortgage_rate_wtf/)*) and decided to finally finish it. Winter is coming to the Philippine real estate realm, folks. Better start preparing.*

\---And now, for the actual post--

Back in September of 2021, we published [RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PRICE INDEX AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MONEY SUPPLY, PRICE INFLATION & LENDING RATE.](https://www.therealestategroupphilippines.com/2021/08/real-estate-price-index-relationship-money-supply-inflation-lending-rate/)

In that piece, our simple linear regression model tried to predict the 2021 values of the BSP/Central Bank's Residential Real Estate Index and Domestic Liquidity level (also known as M3). *Please note that this year 2022, the Central Bank changed the title of Domestic Liquidity to Broad Money.*

See [*Domestic Liquidity Definition from the Depository Corporations Survey October 2021*](https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Media_and_Research/Primers%20Faqs/dcs.pdf)

## Here are the results of the model

>**Predicted RREPI** \- 147.26

>**Actual RREPI** \- 137.8

>**Residual** \- 9.46

Below is a screenshot of the table showing our model's prediction of the RREPI & M3.

And here are the actual RREPI and M3. Screenshots taken from the BSP website...

# What went wrong

The RREPI prediction was off the actual value by 9.46, quite a big number if compared to the other predictions which were only off by +/- 1 or 2 points.

This error is the result of the model's lower M3 prediction. The model predicted that the BSP would increase its M3 to ₱15.8 Trillion by 2021, but it only got to ₱15.3 Trillion, which put the model off by -₱515 Billion. Domestic liquidity (M3) expanded by only 7.9% while the model predicted it to reach 11.5%.

One of the most probable cause for BSP's lower M3 is the country's rising price inflation. A speech of former Central Bank Governor Diokno offers a clue.

[In a speech by former Central Bank Governor Diokno at the Credit Suisse Briefing](https://www.bis.org/review/r220303e.pdf) in Manila last February 17, he said,

>""The BSP’s exit strategy will begin with the recalibration of the BSP’s monetary operations to ensure that our accommodative monetary policy translates to short-term interest rates.""

Noting that,

>""Inflation and growth outlook over the medium term and the associated risks will continue to guide the timing and conditions of BSP’s exit strategy.""

Further stating,

>""...the BSP is mindful of the need to strike a delicate balance between providing adequate stimulus to the economy and preventing the buildup of inflationary pressures and risks to financial stability.""

The Philippine Statistics Authority's [Summary Inflation Report Consumer Price Index for July 2022](https://psa.gov.ph/price-indices/cpi-ir/title/Summary%20Inflation%20Report%20Consumer%20Price%20Index%20%282018%3D100%29%3A%20July%202022), released last August 5, gives us another clue.

[Screenshot4](https://www.therealestategroupphilippines.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CPI-2018100_07_2022_F2.gif)

In our previous blog, we extracted an [infographic from BSP,](https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Media_And_Research/Learning%20Materials/Q32019.pdf) to which a part of it reads,

>""Central Bank determines the level of money supply needed to achieve a desired level of inflation.""

[Screenshot5](https://www.therealestategroupphilippines.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-bsp-m3.png)

Adding these up, the Central Bankers may have lowered M3 in the hopes that it will slowdown price inflation.

Mr. Diokno was optimistic with BSP's overall inflation outlook in his February 2022 speech, forecasting that,

>""For 2021, using the new base year 2018, inflation averaged 3.9 percent. Our latest baseline forecast indicates that inflation is to settle at 3.7 percent in 2022 and 3.3 percent in 2023, well within the target range of 2 to 4 percent.""

The optimistic tone may have been influenced by February's headline inflation of 3%. As of this writing, July headline inflation is at a high of 6.4%. We're already on the second half of the year and BSP's forecast may need some update.

BSP defines headline inflation as, [""the rate of change in the CPI \[Consumer Price Index\], a measure of the average price of a standard basket of goods and services consumed by a typical family.""](https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Media_and_Research/Primers%20Faqs/inflation.pdf)

## Trouble in the construction sector

At this point, we'll need to ring the alarm bells!

Here's PSA's May 2022 [Construction Materials Wholesale Price Index in the National Capital Region](https://psa.gov.ph/price-indices/cmwpi/title/Construction%20Materials%20Wholesale%20Price%20Index%20in%20the%20National%20Capital%20Region%20%282012%3D100%29%3A%20May%202022), released last June 27. The downloadable [statistics table](https://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/attachments/itsd/specialrelease/Statistical%20Tables%20on%20CMWPI%20for%20May%202022.xlsx) shows the following data...

[Screenshot6](https://www.therealestategroupphilippines.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/yoy-CMWPI2.jpg)

Here's a bar chart to make you appreciate it more...

[Chart1](https://www.therealestategroupphilippines.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/yoy-CMWPI-chart-may2022.png)

From May 2021 to May 2022, the index increased by 315%. It's a huge leap compared to the data from [May 2020 (1.3%) to May 2021 (2%)](https://psa.gov.ph/price-indices/cmwpi/title/Construction%20Materials%20Wholesale%20Price%20Index%20in%20the%20National%20Capital%20Region%20%282012%3D100%29%3A%20May%202021), which was only an increase of 54%.

For better visual impact, here's a chart containing the data from May 2020 to May 2022...

[Chart2](https://www.therealestategroupphilippines.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Y-o-Y-CMWPI-in-the-NCR-by-Commodity-Group-May-2020-May-2022.png)

## Average annual family income

The recent [PSA Family Income and Expenditure Survey](https://psa.gov.ph/content/highlights-preliminary-results-2021-annual-family-income-and-expenditure-survey) revealed that the [2021 average annual family income was ₱307,190 for the entire archipelago](https://psa.gov.ph/system/files/Table%201.2%20%20Number%20of%20Families%20and%20Average%20Annual%20Family%20Income%20and%20Expenditure%20%28Current%20Prices%29.xlsx). A decrease of 2% from the 2018 annual income of ₱315,350.

Focusing on the families living in the NCR, their average annual income was ₱417,850 in 2021, a 9.2% drop from the 2018 annual average of ₱460,380. Average annual expenditure for 2021 was at ₱321,590. Doing the math, families were left with an extra ₱96,260 per year after expenses, which translates to ₱8,021 of extra money per month.

This income data will be come in handy in our thought process below.

## What does this mean to us in real estate?

With a July headline inflation hitting 6.4 + 315% Y-o-Y rise in the CMWPI + 9.4% drop in the average annual income of families living in the country's capital, this spells trouble in the real estate industry. *(Update 9/10/22 - headline inflation is now 6.3.* [*Source*](https://psa.gov.ph/price-indices/cpi-ir/title/Summary%20Inflation%20Report%20Consumer%20Price%20Index%20%282018%3D100%29%3A%20August%202022)*)*

The Philippine Constructors Association Inc (PCA). has already appealed to the government for help. In an August 24 Philippine Star article entitled '[Construction industry faces perfect storm](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/08/24/2204599/construction-industry-faces-perfect-storm)', written by Iris Gonzales, she reports that the PCA has sent a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry, informing the government agency that,

>""The cost and expenses borne by our contractors to avert the effects of the pandemic have not yet been fully recovered – resulting in partial and in some cases, a complete shutdown of operations. For others this also meant a discontinuation of their businesses""

If the rising prices persist and income continues to decline, we might see (based on our personal opinion):

1. Fewer residential condominium and subdivision developments in the NCR being started in year 2023. Those that have already started development and sold out pre-selling units are locked-in to whatever total contract price they have given their clients.
2. Fewer real estate developments will jeopardize the job security of construction workers, small construction material suppliers and everyone down the chain.
3. The major residential developments that will be started in year 2023 will cost significantly higher, which in turn will price out (even more) the working middle-class.
4. Many Filipinos in the lower and middle-class looking to construct their own homes may be forced to lower the quality of their build and/or decrease their intended floor area to accommodate the higher material prices.
5. Maintenance and repair of existing homes will be expensive, giving landlords a reasonable excuse to push rental rates up.

It's a winding punch aimed at the gut of every Filipino.

## Politics

As much as we want to exclude politics in the equation, as we've tried to do in the previous blog, it's really part and parcel of the problem and eventual solution. It cannot be excluded.

Statistics from reputable sources, can help us have a better, more grounded view of the state of our country and aide us in making informed decisions.

The unfortunate reality is, even if we implement cost-cutting, belt-tightening measures (i.e. lessen travels, save up more money, limit cappuccinos shots), it would all be worthless if we’re continually inundated with wildcard policies and actions by the government; There are plenty of recent examples that would show that priorities have not been for the good of the country.

## So, what can we do?

* For buyers: if you have the capacity and need to purchase a property either via cash or mortgage, this year would be a good time to do it.
* For sellers: the answer is highly dependent on your financial need.
* For potential residential tenants: rental rates are still relatively affordable and there are still a good number of vacancies so you still have time to go shopping.
* For current residential tenants: if your rent is expiring soon and you plan to remain in the property you're residing in, you may want to negotiate with your landlord to extend your rent and maintain the current rental rate. The success of this action would be highly dependent on the financial situation of your landlord. On the other hand, if you're planning to upgrade, now would be a more practical time to look for another property.
* For residential landlords: if your property is located inside the NCR or other highly urbanized cities and the monthly rental price is equal to or less than ₱10,000, you are covered by Republic Act No. 9653 or known as the [Rent Control Act of 2009](https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2009/ra_9653_2009.html). Under Section 4, Limit on Increases in Rent, it states that,

>""the rent of any residential unit covered by this Act shall not be increased by more than seven percent (7%) annually as long as the unit is occupied by the same lessee""

* For everyone else, you're on your own.
* I'm just kidding! As evidenced by the Rent Control Act, our elected politicians have the power to write laws that could ease the people's burden. Write your representatives in Congress, your Senators, to, as for example, amend RA 9653 to increase the rental price threshold and make the increase in the threshold tax deductible for the landlord.

Thanks for taking the time to read this! Be safe out there!

Anyway, i checked the CMPI index for 2019 (Oct 2019 to be exact) and the CMPI index did rose approx 10.8%. Still a significant increase from 3 years ago but we all know practically every country on this planet is dealing with inflation. So this is moot already.

Now i was wondering though, why would a writer use 315% comparing it from a low base when the practical comparison is with the pre-pandemic level (2019). Then i read this:

Eto yung projected income, seems legit. Pero kung titignan mo yung operating costs, walang spoilage (what if magbrown out? anong mangyayari sa manok?), wala yung unsold inventory (mga nilutong manok na di mo nabenta),  mahina man or malakas ang benta eh same pa rin ang LABOR COSTS?! At 2 lang ang tatao sa business mo kahit na ang recommended ay 4?! Its a customer service nightmare waiting to happen.

Sabi nila worth millions daw ang Franchise ng Mang Boks, tlga? Eh dati is 250k lang. Let's say because of inflation tumaas. Bakit sabi niyo 100k lang ang budget para sa construction costs eh noon ang estimate is 300k-350k, so ang Franchise Fee tumaas pero ang construction cost biglang bumaba?! SUPER SHADY!

Third, pioneering daw ang pagfranchise nila ng Mang Boks kahit 2006 palang nagfrafranchise na cla. Alam ba ng JC Premiere meaning ng pioneer? ""Involving new ideas or methods."" So nagdagdag lang kayo ng MLM component pioneering na?

Also, ang bakit mas malaki pa kikitain mo sa recruiting kaysa sa pagooperate ng Franchise? They will pay 25,000 per direct referral daw at wait there's more, meron na naman 7 Accounts ng JC Premiere ""included"". Kung magooperate ka ng legit na business, bakit Networking na naman ang ending mo?!

May PROMO na naman sila na First 50 people lang daw ang may discount, hanggang ngaun nakapromo pa din ang TOKTOK! Kawawa na naman mga Pinoy na nito!

Sa mga franchisee in this thread let me know what you think. JC Premiere somehow was able to block some of my Youtube videos about them in the Philippine. Pero Im still able to post sa Tiktok at Facebook at napapanood pa din ng OFWS which is also their target market, I want to know if there is anything I should add.

If hyperinflation indeed hits us, better to go back to your province. Try to produce all the necessities you can have at your home. Primary things are food, water, and energy. 

Going back to your province is also an advantage with the remote overseas work that pays in USD. If you really think that hyperinflation is already coming, you can try converting your PHP to USD for now. Make sure that those USD are in your hands. If it is in the banks, bad luck since they will prevent you from withdrawing it or taking it out in USD form.

With the pandemic slowing down our economic growth and hyperinflation becoming more and more possible, we are in for a **stagflation**. Meaning even if you have skills, it will be really hard to secure a job/work. Going back to the basics is the way to go. Plant your own food. Produce your own energy. Be self sufficient. During this time you can hone your skills. When the time comes that our economy picks up steam, you can bounce back right away and higher. 

Getting out of the country is not even an option for you since you have dependents that you are taking care of and finding an overseas job also eats up money, time, and resources.

However, during times of inflation, savers kinda get the short end of the stick, kasi yung savings nila bumababa yung halaga in terms of what it can purchase compared to before.

The financial vehicles that rise with inflation are usually: stocks and real estate.  I would recommend you put a bit into stocks... If you have a long term perspective (say 5+ years) on it and pick a safe strategy (e.g., look up Index investing), stocks are great against inflation.  

Real estate din sana, but it's crazy how much real estate costs in the big cities.  You might look into your own province's city for cheaper real estate and see if it's viable.

>- **[NEWS]     BSP raises policy rate by 50 basis points...** The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) [[source](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/business/2022/9/22/BSP-monetary-policy-meeting-September-22.html)], our central bank and rough equivalent of the US Federal Reserve (US Fed), met yesterday and decided to raise the benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 4.25%. This rate is used by banks to set the price for renting money (loan interest rates), and should (in theory) impact everything from savings deposit rates to mortgage rates.
>    - ***MB:*** *The BSP might be aggressive relative to its own history, but this the second meeting cycle in a row where the US Fed came out with a strong raise and the BSP failed to keep pace. The peso has melted in value relative to the US Dollar, in part because of this difference, and it will (probably?) continue to melt because of the BSP’s approach. The US Fed basically signaled that the 75 bp raises will continue until inflation looks controllable, but the BSP seems far less guided by any clear metric. Peso weakness will probably get worse before it gets better.*

>- **[META]     Adjustment to the calculation of Citicore Energy REIT’s estimated yield...** Citicore Energy REIT [CREIT 2.26 ▼1.74%] is unique in that it generates a regular, quarterly dividend from the lease revenue that it earns from its properties, and it also generates an annual special dividend from the variable profit-sharing clause in its lease contracts that gives CREIT shareholders a small percentage cut of certain energy selling profits. CREIT provided estimates for both the regular quarterly lease dividends and the special annual profit-sharing dividend, but up until today, my REIT Tracker had only considered the regular quarterly lease dividends when trying to estimate CREIT’s forward-looking yield. I’d originally excluded the special dividends categorically, as special dividends are usually reserved for situations that are unforeseen, or hard to predict, and I didn’t feel comfortable baking any kind of prediction into the yield estimation. On reflection, I don’t think that’s what is going on here. I contacted CREIT, and they confirmed that the variable revenues were still tracking according to the predictions in the prospectus. I still think it’s more speculative than I’m comfortable doing to include the special dividend into the calculation, but I think it’s also an inaccurate picture of what the CREIT model offers to ignore it.
>    - ***MB:*** *I am choosing a “trust but verify” approach to improve the accuracy of the MB REIT Tracker. The whole purpose of the tracker is to give readers a better sense of the relative cost/benefit of one REIT compared to another, and considering that the forward-looking yield estimate is itself somewhat speculative (extrapolating the last dividend out into the future), it doesn’t feel like doing this with CREIT’s prospectus data is that far outside of what I’m already doing. For now, I’m taking the FY22 variable income, chopping that into quarters, dividing that by outstanding shares, and adding that to the dividend before annualizing for the estimated yield. While CREIT predicts the variable income to increase in 2023, I’m not applying 2023 estimated variable income to the quarters in 2023 that form part of the estimate just yet. All of the additions are based on the lower 2022 estimate from the prospectus. For transparency, I will always include a note in the REIT Tracker to keep everyone aware of how I’m calculating CREIT’s dividend, just so we’re all on the same page.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **Bank of Commerce** [BNCOM 9.11 ▼4.11%] [[source](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=825fe64f45de3bb83470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed that 879 million shares held by subsidiaries of San Miguel [SMC 97.65 ▼0.36%] will come out of mandatory lockup on the night of September 27, and will be available for active trading on the morning of September 28. 
>        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *BNCOM has staged a significant price recovery after a really dark post-IPO period where its price dropped to P8.00/share. That said, I don’t think SMC is the kind of company that is likely to drip-sell BNCOM shares on the open market for a little bit of quick liquidity. I mean, I’m still going to watch that morning to make sure, but it’s just not really the way they do it. Bonds and prefs, though? All day long.*
>    - **Citicore Energy REIT** [CREIT 2.26 ▼1.74%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=083108ceb77cef763470cea4b051ca8f)] board approved issuance of ₱4.5 billion in unsecured fixed rate ASEAN green bonds. ₱3 billion of that amount will be the """"base"""" amount, with up to ₱1.5 billion in additional bonds available through an oversubscription option. 
>        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *This amount would maximize CREIT's available debt quota under the REIT Law, which forms the majority of its current P6.5 billion in """"buying power"""" (a proprietary REIT stat that I calculate and track that represents the amount of value that a REIT could acquire using a combination of available debt and equity up to the minimum public ownership threshold). Maybe the thinking is to sell the bonds now, at a time when rates look like they'll be the cheapest that they'll be before maybe like 2024, and use that cash to download additional assets from CREIT's sponsor/parent to expand capacity. I'm curious to see what kind of rates they'll need to give in order to sell the bonds, though.*
>    - **Solar Philippines** [SPNEC 1.24 ▼1.59%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=b69c97150adfcea63470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed that its owner, Leandro Leviste, bought 10 million shares on Wednesday for around ₱1.27/share. The purchases were done through a private company that Mr. Leviste owns, called Countryside Investments Holdings Corporation, which now holds 310 million SPNEC shares representing 3.1% of SPNEC’s outstanding shares. 
>        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *SPNEC has been in free-fall since around the time of its stock rights offering offer period. Is Mr. Leviste picking up some more of his own supply on the cheap, or is he trying to buy some peace of mind for SPNEC investors who have become increasingly vocal about SPNEC’s poor stock price performance?
>    - **Converge** [CNVRG 14.92 ▼11.30%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=55af09144cb41ef33470cea4b051ca8f)] announced a stock buy-back program with a budget of ₱1.5 billion, which was approved by the board on September 22. CNVRG said that the buy-back was intended to “demonstrate confidence in the Company’s fundamental value”. The stock is down 62% over the past 12 months.*
>        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *Soon after that October 2021 high is when things started going off the rails for CNVRG’s stock price. CNVRG’s American partner, Coherent Cloud, hastily dumped 5.6% of CNVRG’s outstanding shares in a block sale that seemed to shock the market and catch CNVRG flat-footed. CNVRG tried to make lemonade by soaking up Coherent Cloud’s follow-up sale in May, but all the positive spin couldn’t mask the haste of Coherent Cloud’s exit. New subscriber growth has slowed (it’s still going up, but the rate of that increase is decreasing), and now there are whispers around town (echoed by [COL’s April Tan](https://twitter.com/AprilLeeTan/status/1572798345902723072))  that CNVRG may be removed from the MSCI Index in November. Does this buy-back program stop the bleeding? Hard to say. CNVRG does an average of ₱188 million in value traded each day, so this plan represents only about eight full days of trading volume. That said, judicious application of a buy-back can have an outsized impact on price, as we saw earlier this year with DoubleDragon [DD 6.98 ▼0.43%]. We’ll have to wait and see.*
>    - **Synergy Grid** [SGP 12.10 ▼0.17%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=e453535c781dea853470cea4b051ca8f)] declared a Q3 cash dividend of ₱0.26/share, payable on October 19 to shareholders of record as of October 5. 
>        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *These dividends are what have been consumed and excreted through the various segments of the corporate centipede that the company’s owners used to attempt to satisfy the public listing requirements of their nation-wide power transmission franchise. Using SGP’s Thursday closing price of ₱12.10/share, this dividend represents an annualized (estimated) yield of 8.59%. That’s a decent return. Especially for people who bought SGP at ~₱11.30/share (9.20% estimated yield) back in March. Less so for people who bought it two weeks ago for ~₱13.80/share (7.49% estimated yield).*

I hear a lot of people saying that the  Philippine economy is gloomy, even comparing our situation with Sri Lanka. While I understand the sentiments, it is also good to be a little pragmatic. Looking at our indicators, I think we are still fine, at least for now. 

As per global standards, Gross International Reserves should cover at least 3 months worth of imports and so far, Philippines reserves can cover 9 months worth of imports. S&P global says a good credit rating is BBB- or higher, and Philippines currently has BBB (Stable), which way better than Sri Lanka's SD (Sovereign Default), Ukraine's CCC+ and Russia's C status. Credit rating is the evaluation of a country's economic, political environments and financial situations expressed in credit rating/investment grade. We also have a young and productive demographics which is 25. We are not perfect of course, and some of the things that our next government needs to work on are Unemployment rate, Inflation, and Debt-to-GDP.

We're BBB+ with S&P, not BBB. More on this, our external position is actually a huge reason why we're BBB+. The 3 month port cover is true, but you should also consider external debt compared to our reserves. We're still in a pretty good position but it's deteriorating. The weakning peso will also affect our ability to repay, and we may have to use more reserves.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[COMING_UP]     A look at the week ahead for October 24-28...** On the domestic front, it feels a little bit like lunch-time at the office; everybody is here, but nobody is working. On Friday, the Globe [GLO 2330.00 ▼5.97%] stock rights offering (SRO) will list. This means that all of the SRO shares that were purchased by GLO shareholders will be active and available for trading on that day. Saturday is the deadline for Marvin Dela Cruz to make a cash payment for the shares he purchased to assume control of Premiere Horizon Alliance [PHA 0.28 ▲3.77%], after the PHA board rejected Marvin’s ability to satisfy his debt with “unviable” sQuidPay shares. That might be challenging for him, as he is already being sued by his fellow board member for non-payment of the loan he used to make the original downpayment. On the international front, everyone is just trying to sift through the information available to get a better idea for what the US Federal Reserve will decide on rate hikes in November and December. There are no big “fireworks” events for the BSP or the US Fed this week, but next week will certainly be spicy with the US Fed meeting on November 3 and a US jobs report out on November 5.
>    - ***MB:*** *There’s no consensus on whether the US has “contained” inflation, and plenty of evidence to suggest that the actual amount of inflation is higher than the reported figures. Yet, everyone is fairly certain that the rate hike beatings will continue until inflation morale improves. The BSP has said that it will spend US Dollar reserves buying pesos on the open market to help prop up the price of our currency, which seems like a coded way of saying that the BSP doesn’t plan to be as aggressive as the US Fed in raising rates to combat inflation domestically.*

>- **[Q&A]     What’s happening with Apollo Global Capital?...** This question comes from Christian, and is more of a multi-parter. It goes something like this: What’s the operational status of Apollo Global Capital [APL 0.03 ▼3.45%]? What are they doing? Are they even doing anything? Does the SEC/PSE monitor the use of the proceeds for their follow-on offering? Did they use that money according to the plan? Thank you for your question, Christian. I’ve received several questions like this about APL from frustrated shareholders; your series of questions captures the overall tone of the shareholders I’ve spoken with remarkable precision. Let’s start with the operational status of APL. Is it actually doing any off-shore mining? Not that I can tell, despite disclosures from as early as January 2021 saying that its mining ship was “in position” and ready to start operations. They’ve given every excuse in the book for the nearly two-year delay, from bad weather to seemingly random safety upgrades. And yet, through it all, the iron ore remains safely nestled in its cozy underwater bed. If APL isn’t doing any mining, what is it doing? Well, it did spend a lot of time organizing that weird follow-on offering (FOO) to raise money to buy a minority stake in the Singaporean company that owns the MV Siphon 1, the ship that APL has leased to perform the theoretical mining. Oh, and its largest shareholder, a Korean named Hyung Rae Doo, sold 33% of his stake in the company when his shares exited lockup after the FOO was conducted. So that also happened. But no mining. As for whether the SEC/PSE monitors the use of the proceeds of a FOO, the answer to that is “yes”, and this is done by requiring the issuing company to provide periodic disclosure of the disbursements made and to have those disbursements audited. To that end, APL did exactly what it said it would do: it spent the proceeds on buying that minority stake in the Singaporean company that owns the boat that it doesn’t use.
>    - ***MB:*** *The stock is down 91% from its high of ₱0.32/share back in January 2021, which is oddly around the same time that APL started to make public statements that the start of operations for the country’s first off-shore iron mine was imminent. The stock price now is 25% lower than its COVID-crash low of ₱0.04/share. You have to go back seven years to May of 2015 to find a time when this stock was worth less than it is today. After spending so much time raising money to buy a minority stake in the boat, are APL shareholders any closer to seeing their company actually take iron ore out of the seabed? APL never indicated that obtaining a minority stake in the boat was a condition precedent to the start of operations, but their urgency to conduct the raise and send the money to Singapore certainly seemed to imply that it was something that needed to be done before the real work could begin. But now that it’s done, what now? When APL first started to make statements that it was ready to begin in January of 2021, iron ore was selling for around $150 per ton. Six months later, iron ore was up 47% and selling for $220 per ton. Now it’s sitting around $100 per ton. Did APL miss a once-in-a-generation window to sell iron ore at a huge premium? Probably. But you know, as the old saying goes: “The best time to sell iron ore is during the biggest pump in a generation, the second best time is... literally any other time.” Hopefully the weather gets better soon.*

>- **[NOTES] Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **Department of Finance** (DoF) says it will use ₱10-B to avoid breach of ₱60/$1 “psychological level”. DoF Secretary, Benjamin Diokno, said that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) would use $10 billion of its “Gross International Reserves” [[link](https://business.inquirer.net/368895/peso-defense-measures-stall-currencys-slide)] to prevent the peso’s value from falling through the ₱60:$1 barrier, which the government considers to be a “psychological” level that it must “defend”, as directed by the President. Secretary Diokno added that the BSP would “probably consider” 100 basis points of additional rate hikes in the BSP’s final two meetings of the year. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *While Mr. Diokno is still a member of the BSP’s monetary board, some of what he’s saying here is somewhat out of pocket for a DoF secretary. The currency market intervention and rate hikes might have been the direct purview of Mr. Diokno when he was the BSP Governor during the previous administration, but Felipe Medalla is the governor now, and the BSP operates independent of the DoF’s chain of command. That said, the distinction might only be academic on this point, as it doesn’t seem like Mr. Diokno or Mr. Medalla differ in their intended approach to solving the currency problem. Mr. Medalla talked about 100 bp of rate hikes first, before Mr. Diokno, and while he hasn’t spoken publicly about the BSP’s intervention in the open currency market, he did say previously that the peso’s weakness “threatens” the government’s inflation outlook. So I don’t expect the BSP and DoF to be in conflict on either point.*
>    - **Metro Pacific** [MPI 3.61 ▲3.14%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=59950f783f4562c23470cea4b051ca8f)] noted that the Supreme Court affirmed a ruling that held Maynilad, an MPI associate company, was in violation of the Philippine Clean Water Act (CWA). Maynilad has been instructed to pay ₱202 million in fines, which MPI said was a “significant reduction” from the original fine. The Supreme Court reduced Maynilad’s fine based on the court’s assessment that Maynilad had exerted “good faith and real efforts to comply with [the CWA]”. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *This is like when a bank sets aside a huge chunk of money as provisions for bad loans, only to find out that the actual amount of bad loans was just 25% of that huge chunk. Technically, it’s a W to pay less than expected, but realistically it’s still an L to be paying a considerable fraction of a “huge chunk of money” in fines. Still, the issue is resolved, the fines will be paid.*
>    - **Manila Water** [MWC 15.50 ▲1.31%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=d83e937d0240a1c83470cea4b051ca8f)] confirmed reports that it planned to spend ₱181 billion over the next five years, but clarified that ₱105 billion would be for capex related to water and wastewater projects, and ₱76 billion would be for “operations expenditure”. MWC said that the spending was in line with the “service improvement plan” that it submitted to its regulating body, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *The water concessionaires have been under pressure to uphold their end of the bargain under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Both MWC and Maynilad (owned by Metro Pacific [MPI 3.61 ▲3.14%] and DMCI [DMC 10.46 ▼0.38%]) just recently had liability affirmed by the Supreme Court for violations of the CWA, so this increased spend is part of that catch-up, as is MWC’s plans to build 12 more sewage treatment plants.*

#The PSE lost 39 points to 6721 ▼0.6%

So that was a wild ride.

I'm seeing a ton of ""BBM win = PSEi death"" sentiments. While everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I'm not about to turn MB into a political blog, I think it's important to put some things into perspective.

Duterte's election back in 2016 was supposed hurt the stock market, too, and while he did egregious things (WEB, MWC, ABS, etc) that smelled strongly of politics and hurt personal feelings, and stepped over the invisible/intangible line that should exist between the power of the President and the stock market, the ""they'll lose trust in us for all the killings"" narrative never really panned out. Yes, there was a good deal of foreign selling, and a lot of terrible international press about the President, but that didn't cripple the PSE. COVID aside, companies were still growing and thriving in the evolving PH economy.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]     The post-election market was a wild ride with some interesting scares...** The PSE [[link](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/PCOMP:IND)] opened its first day of trading since Monday’s Presidential election down significantly. Within 5 minutes of the open, the PSE was down over 200 points (▼ 3.1%) to 6,547, and there was an eerie mix of excitement and panic through all of the forums at what was happening. Some feared that foreigners would mass-sell and exit the market (there was ₱1 billion of net foreign selling, but it wasn’t really that noteworthy). Some gleefully watched and speculated on the “crony stocks” horserace between Prime Media Holdings [PRIM 2.00 ▲38.89%], owned by Imelda Marcos’s nephew, Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, PhilWeb [WEB 4.06 ▲30.97%], owned Irene Marcos’s husband, Greggy Araneta, Araneta Properties [ARA 1.70 ▲30.77%], also owned by Greggy Araneta, plus DITO CME [DITO 5.40 ▲8.00%] and Chelsea [C 1.59 ▲6.71%], which are both owned by Dennis Uy. Still, from those frightening first few minutes, the market quickly recovered over 100 points in the next hour, to reach back up to 6,667 just before the lunch break. After the break, the market kind of floated sideways, then heaved up just at the end to close at 6,720. Down a relatively pedestrian 39 points (▼0.60%) that did not, by itself, tell the story of the whole day that came before it!
>    - ***MB:*** *To me, the greatest “signals” from this day were from the media subsector. The early moments of trading were absolutely dominated by the complete face-plant of nearly all non-PRIM media stocks, like ABS-CBN [ABS 10.40 ▼19.38%], GMA [GMA7 11.18 ▼11.97%], Manila Broadcasting Company [MBC 7.54 ▼22.27%]. It’s pretty obvious why ABS might tank, as the Marcos/Duterte tandem is unlikely to be very sympathetic to the Lopez Family’s interest in returning to broadcasting. ABS is faced with an even longer winter of scrambling to monetize its catalog of intellectual property in whatever way it can, while trying to retain its talent and hold its breath for the time when it might be able to work with some spectrum of its own again. Those times do not appear to be close at hand. It’s less obvious, though, why GMA7 and MBC would also flash-crash, but my thinking is that the market is anticipating the rise of the Marcos-related PRIM, the continued metastasization of Apollo Quiboloy’s Sonshine Media Network International (SMNI), and the inevitable onslaught of Manny Villar’s media empire through his Advanced Media Broadcasting System (AMBS) company that took over ABS’s old spectrum at the start of the year. My judgment on whether these developments are good or bad for the country don’t really matter, but it’s pretty clear that the market thinks that this election means that there will be a considerable change in the preferred players in the domestic media ecosystem. A pack of obscure and poorly-known new favorites.*

>- **[Q1]     Semirara Mining and Power Q1 profit ▲552% y/y, ▲154% q/q...** Semirara Mining and Power [SCC 27.10 ▼4.24%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=0774000bc178c7963470cea4b051ca8f)], the Consunji-led coal mining and power firm, reported a Q1/22 profit of ₱15.0 billion, up 552% from its Q1/21 profit of ₱2.3 billion, and up 154% from its Q4/21 profit of ₱5.9 billion. While SCC has warned that its earnings for this year may be “uneven” due to the volatility of commodity prices and the poor weather expected in the 2nd half of the year that might hamper its mining efforts, this Q1 result nearly matched SCC’s profit from the entire year in 2021. SCC attributed its record quarter to “strong operational results” and “stronger-than-expected market conditions” related to the price of coal and electricity.
>    - ***MB:*** *SCC ripped more coal out of the ground than ever at a time when the world was paying a lot of money for coal, and SCC sold more electricity than usual at a time when the spot market was willing to pay “elevated prices”. SCC is in the right place at the right time for all aspects of its business right now. Those that got in early are reaping huge rewards on the appreciation of the stock price (up 121% over the past year), but also on SCC’s thick dividends. Looks like that gravy train is not slowing down, at least not this quarter, and at least not until something happens to the global price of coal to bring this rocketship back down to earth. SCC’s warning about its ability to maintain this high level of mine output through the bad weather in the 2nd half of the year is a valid one; SCC has struggled through mudslides, floods, and other mishaps that have greatly reduced its mining output through that part of the year. If the weather is not as severe as expected, or SCC is able to implement appropriate mitigation measures, shareholders might still get a few more rounds out of this champion yet.*

>- **[NEWS]     AyalaLand Logistics looking to get into the “common data center” business...** AyalaLand Logistics [ALLHC 4.06 ▼3.79%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=480fb64c9482b9b23470cea4b051ca8f)], the industrial lot re-seller subsidiary of the Ayala Family’s real estate arm, Ayala Land [ALI 31.50 ▼3.08%], announced yesterday that it had signed a “framework agreement” with FLOW Holdings I Philippines (FLOW), a subsidiary of FLOW Digital Infrastructure, to develop “carrier neutral” data centers “across the Philippines.” FLOW is the digital infrastructure arm of PAG, an ASEAN-focused private equity group, which already has over US $2 billion in data center assets under management. The pair’s first facility (4.5-MW)  is scheduled to be ready for service by Q4 of next year. ALLHC’s press release touted the modular nature of FLOW’s approach as beneficial in terms of getting new data centers up and running quickly.
>    - ***MB:*** *The data center gold rush is real, but I feel like we’re missing some key financial information to make sense of the constant stream of press releases about new data center developments. It seems like we’ve all just landed on “more data centers would be great”, and all the big names have gone out and done what they can to generate news that has “data center” in the headline. PLDT [TEL 1848.00 ▼2.22%] announced that it was making a [100-MW data center](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/pldt-to-develop-100mw-data-center-in-santa-rosa-the-philippines/) in Sta. Rosa (it’s 11th data center), Globe [GLO 2370.00 ▼3.81%] said that it would look to [“carve out” its data center business ](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/globe-in-advanced-discussions-to-form-data-center-jv-with-stt-gdc-in-the-philippines/)with a Singaporean firm,  DITO CME [DITO 5.40 ▲8.00%] announced late last year that it was developing a [“hyperscale” data center ](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/dito-planning-hyperscale-facility-in-philippines/)in Clark Global City, and Converge [CNVRG 27.60 ▼5.32%] announced that it was pairing its 14-MW data center in Angeles City with a [geothermal energy site](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/philippines-converge-secures-14mw-geothermal-energy-contract/). I’ll admit that this whole data center thing is a blindspot for me, personally, that I hope to remedy soon, as I want to be able to read this news and get a feeling for what a company like ALLHC is potentially getting through a partnership like this. It seems like a chance for ALLHC to convert some of its well-placed industrial lots into a business that generates recurring income, instead of just selling those lots for one-time gains. That might be a great way to monetize some of ALLHC’s land holdings. But again, I don’t know. I’m just speculating here.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **JP Morgan** [[link](https://business.inquirer.net/347572/j-p-morgan-drops-ph-to-bottom-of-asean-investment-preference-list-after-may-9-polls)] seemed to react to the election by dropping our ranking to “last” in an “investment preference” list of ASEAN nations, citing “twin deficits, higher inflation, slower government spending in the quarters after the election (transition pain), high public debt, risk of a valuation derating and potential earnings growth disappointment” as reasons for the change. JP Morgan’s advice: “We recommend selling into a possible post-election hope rally.” That’s brutal. But, that’s only one (albeit, loud) voice.
>    - **PSE** [PSE 210.00 ▲0.96%] website was down for most of the day yesterday. Buy/sell orders were going through just fine, but the public-facing site was not loading at all. Perhaps it was gently hugged to death by the thousands of non-traders trying to see if the BBM election was crashing the markets.
>    - **CTS Global** [CTS 0.95 ▼5.00%] [[link](https://www1.pse.com.ph/stockMarket/companyInfo.html?id=693&security=688&tab=0)] fell 5% to close significantly below its IPO price of ₱1.00. Despite listing without a stabilization fund, the stock has stuck to the ₱1.00/share level basically since its IPO, mysteriously supported by some one or group that is keen on defending that ₱1.00/share level. This doesn’t seem particularly “normal” from an observational perspective, so it will be interesting to see what happens now that the level has been breached. Quick reversion?

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]     Meralco uncertainty as rumors of DoE Secretary pick circulate...** Meralco [MER 362.00 unch] [[link](https://www.bworldonline.com/top-stories/2022/06/02/452398/marcoleta-among-marcos-picks-for-energy-chief/)], the power distribution company, was recently drawn back into a zone of uncertainty after rumors circulated that President-elect Marcos was considering Rodante Marcoleta, the House deputy speaker, for a cabinet position as Secretary of the Department of Energy. Mr. Marcoleta was elected as a party-lister, and he remains a congressman today after a failed bid to run for election to the Senate. Mr. Marcoleta is best known for his 2021 call for “early review” of MER’s franchise, on the basis of the allegation that MER overcharged customers during the COVID-19 lockdown, after he participated in the successful political termination of ABS-CBN’s [ABS 9.98 ▼2.92%] franchise renewal fiasco. Metro Pacific Investments [MPI 3.76 ▲1.08%] owns the largest single stake in MER, with JG Summit [JGS 51.70 ▼4.26%] holding a lesser (but still significant) stake.
>    - ***MB:*** *I do not like to mix finance and politics, but it’s a fact of life that these two spheres of life have considerable overlap, especially in a place like the Philippines. Make no mistake, if Mr. Marcoleta is selected for the role of DoE Secretary, it won’t be in spite of his vocal opposition to MER’s franchise, it will be because of it, and shareholders of MER should likely prepare for a potential battle. What would such a battle look like? Well, we’ve already seen two high-profile interventions by the current administration into bedrock corporations like Manila Water [MWC 17.22 ▼4.23%] and ABS, with MWC as the playbook for forced ownership change and unilateral renegotiation, and ABS the playbook for basic value destruction. Pandora’s box was opened a long time ago, and this kind of intervention, leading with the “just asking questions” approach, has probably been normalized. This is one to watch closely. The cost of electricity is not going down, and with the price of coal rising and inflation still doing its thing, this conflict could become a convenient populist button for the administration to push at some point. This is not a political statement, this is simply a factual risk that needs to be recognized.*

>- **[NEWS]     Prime Infra Holdings set to acquire controlling interest in Dennis Uy’s Malampaya project...** Prime Infra Holdings (PIH) [[link](https://www.rappler.com/business/enrique-razon-to-acquire-dennis-uy-controlling-stake-malampaya/)], the private holdco owned by Enrique Razon, announced that it was in discussions to acquire a controlling interest in the Malampaya natural gas project from Udenna Corp, the private holdco owned by Dennis Uy. There were no details released on the size of the stake to be acquired, or the price that PIH will pay for that stake, but the statements of PIH and Udenna seem to suggest that Dennis Uy (through Udenna) will stay invested in the project with a minority stake of some size.
>    - ***MB:*** *While this doesn’t technically touch any publicly-traded companies on the PSE, it is interesting to note that Enrique Razon appears to be the oligarch best positioned to pick up the pieces from other oligarchs that have experienced “sudden political instability”, as with the Ayala Family’s conflict with President Duterte that prompted the Ayalas to sell a controlling stake in Manila Water [MWC 17.22 ▼4.23%] to Enrique Razon a few years ago. Razon also seems well positioned to scoop up distressed assets from businessmen that are overextended and unable to navigate the changing economic and political landscape. Regardless of how all these magnificent jewels end up under Enrique Razon’s control, the real test of Razon’s acquisition streak will be his ability to actually operate these assets competently and maintain steady control for many years to come. Razon and his team have demonstrated an ability to operate through difficult financial times, even in industries like gaming that were absolutely decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic.*

>- **[NEWS]     Jollibee to spend $60-M to expand Tim Ho Wan in China...** Jollibee [JFC 228.40 ▼0.26%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=2c51c0f043c780ac3470cea4b051ca8f)] said yesterday that it will push US $60 million into the Titan Dining fund, which owns the Tim Ho Wan restaurant chain. JFC owns 90% of Titan Dining. The capital injection will increase the fund’s committed capital from $156 million to $217 million, which the fund will use to expand Tim Ho Wan in mainland China. JFC, the global quick service restaurant behemoth owned by Tony Caktiong, currently has 11 Tim Ho wan restaurants in China, mostly in Shanghai, but plans to open 100 new restaurants over the next four years in other parts of the country. The expansion also aligns with Mr. Caktiong’s desire to grow JFC’s non-Philippines portfolio to become roughly [50% of its revenue and profit](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/09/29/2212919/jollibee-plans-hike-share-foreign-businesses-50). Currently, JFC earns approximately 45% of its revenue from its non-Philippines locations. Internally, JFC considers the Philippines, China, and the US to be its “three major growth centers”. JFC CEO, Ernesto Tanmantiong, said recently that the company’s goal is to “see these three pillar markets contribute equally”.
>    - ***MB:*** *This move shows that JFC is not afraid to be aggressive in difficult times. Considering the state of the Chinese restaurant industry during China’s ill-fated “zero-COVID” policy and all of the lockdowns that have come with it, maybe Mr. Caktiong is looking at all the figurative blood in the streets and thinking it’s a great time to build a meaningful footprint. JFC has a lot of building and expanding to do in order to grow the China and US markets to be equal, individually, to the income-generation and profitability of what it’s built here in the Philippines. That kind of long-term diversification will help JFC weather any future COVID-like scenarios that arise through epidemics or natural disasters related to climate change. The brutal impact of the original PH lockdown, and the uneven nature of the response around the globe, must have been a tremendous eye-opener to the group.*

>- **[NEWS]     Asian Development Bank thinks Karding’s inflationary impact will be minimal...** Asian Development Bank (ADB) [[link](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/09/29/q4-typhoons-wont-impact-inflation-much-says-adb/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=q4-typhoons-wont-impact-inflation-much-says-adb)] doubts that expectations of inflation caused by Karding will become reality, noting that the storm “quickly crossed the country with relatively little damage”. ADB also said that it is not concerned about additional typhoons in Q4 adding to inflationary pressure to prices, though it didn’t provide any explicit reasons why this would be so. ADB said that it is “unlikely” to revise its inflation forecast for the remainder of the year based on the damage caused by Karding, and is not “looking at any significant changes to the outlook projections that we just released last week”. ADB just recently raised its inflation outlook to 5.3% for the year, up from its original estimate of 4.9%.
>    - ***MB:*** *These are all just scraps of opinion to consume and integrate into our overall understanding of what’s happened, how what’s happened will impact us, and how we should adjust our projections of what might happen to us in the future based on that. My big concern with ADB’s reasoning that Q4 storms shouldn’t be a problem is that they acknowledged that Karding passed through the “rice basket of the Philippines”, but that Karding’s inflationary impact is likely to be minimal because the storm passed quickly and didn’t seem to cause a lot of damage. What if Karding did cause a lot of damage? Would ADB suddenly change its Q4 projections based on a new-found respect for potential storm damage? I suspect not. I think ADB is more or less married to the assumptions that it’s already made, and is basically relieved that Karding’s impact was (compared to fears) small. Here is the key take-away: remember this approach if/when ADB further adjusts its GDP growth estimates and inflation forecasts. If we get storms that cause damage to crops in Q4, they’re going to have to adjust because they explicitly ignored these impacts. Their numbers represent a “best case scenario” from a weather perspective.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **MREIT** [MREIT 13.90 ▼3.47%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=9b72080fc295fede3470cea4b051ca8f)] will have 1.57 billion shares come out of 365-day lockup on Monday morning. The shares are owned by MREIT’s sponsor/parent, Megaworld [MEG 2.06 ▼0.96%], and represent 62.09% of MREIT’s outstanding shares. MEG has not provided any guidance on its intentions with these shares once they become active and tradeable.
>        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *It’s not usually part of the oligarch/conglomerate playbook to drip-sell or rug-pull on an IPO after the 180-day or 365-day lockups have expired, but customary behaviors aren’t laws and trust still needs to be verified. Unlike San Miguel [SMC 97.50 unch] when its shares in Bank of Commerce [BNCOM 8.97 ▼1.54%] came out of lockup, MEG hasn’t told us what it plans to do with the shares, so all we can do is guess. I don’t expect to see any selling, but again, I’m only basing that off of past behaviors.*
>    - **Aboitiz Power** [AP 30.70 ▼0.97%] [[link](https://www.psalm.gov.ph/home)] will see another of its officers “ascend” to an appointed position within government, as AP’s First Vice President for Regulatory Affairs, Dennis de la Serna, has been named the President and CEO of the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM). This government-owned corporation is in charge of selling off Napocor’s power generation assets and real estate. PSALM sells these assets through a bidding process meant to optimize the government’s return on these assets. AP is a common bidder in PSALM auctions, and has purchased assets from PSALM in the past in this way.
>        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *As [Bilyonaryo noted](https://bilyonaryo.com/2022/09/28/sabin-scores-rare-grand-slam-in-power-third-aboitiz-exec-gets-plum-energy-post-as-bbm-appoints-dennis-de-la-serna-new-psalm-boss/business/), this is the third AP executive to be appointed to a position of authority over the domestic energy industry in this administration. AP’s ex-VP of Regulatory Affairs is the PSALM CEO, its ex-Independent Director is now Department of Energy Secretary, and its ex-Chief Legal Counsel is now Energy Regulatory Commission Chair. This is a clear-cut example of regulatory capture, where government agencies are staffed by former/current executives of heavyweights in the industries that they are supposed to monitor and manage. These appointments create clear conflicts of interest that are difficult to cure. Will AP be unfairly prioritized? Will AP have access to information that other energy players will not be able to see? We don’t have any effective way to know, and this is why conflicts of interest are so challenging to deal with, and why they should be avoided at all costs to maintain a level playing field.*
>    - **Colliers International** (Colliers) [[link](https://www.colliers.com/en-ph/research/property-market-intelligence-eton-properties-office-market-bataan-industrial)] said that it has “yet to see substantial deals from POGOs that dominated the market pre-Covid-19.” Colliers noted that at the end of Q2/22, POGOs accounted for 677,000 square meters of occupied space in Metro Manila, down 48% from the Q1/20 high of 1,300,000 square meters. Colliers said that the LT Group’s [LTG 8.23 ▼2.02%] signing of 6,000 square meters of space to a POGO in Makati is not a sign of recovery for the POGO sector.
>        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *LTG’s press release made it sound like that one POGO signing fixed the whole market. Perhaps LTG’s press release was more wishful and political in nature than it was analytical and factual, considering the news behind the scenes that the administration (and the Senate) is interested in banning POGO companies outright. This analysis from Colliers would seem to support an argument that POGOs are not currently “on a comeback”.*

>- **[NEWS]     Philippine Stock Exchange [PSE 211.00  unch] wins “best exchange in SE Asia” award, promptly fails to open due to technical glitch...** Sometimes the world just has impeccable comedic timing. Before the market was scheduled to open, news that the PSE had won the “[Best Stock Exchange in SE Asia](https://www.bworldonline.com/pse-named-best-stock-exchange-in-southeast-asia/)” award from the Alpha Southeast Asia magazine was already getting a round of jeers and playful taunts on Twitter. The exchange apparently won the award thanks to “high-profile landmark issues”, such as the record-breaking IPO of Monde Nissin [MONDE 15.70  unch], which contributed to the PSE breaking its own record for capital-raising activities in a year with ₱234 billion (8 IPOs, 11 FOOs, 4 SROs, and 8 private placements). Then things got weird. The PSE failed to open at 9:30am. The PSE released a statement blaming the delayed start on a “technical issue” that somehow caused 43 of the PSE’s 125 brokers to be unable to access the PSE’s trading engine. PSE President Ramon Monzon explained that the Revised Trading Rules require the exchange to halt trading if at least one-third of brokers are unable to access the trading system. Later, in a [text message screencap](https://twitter.com/miguelrcamusINQ/status/1478197378633314315) posted by the Inquirer’s Miguel R. Camus, Mr. Monzon said that both the PSE’s trading platform provider (NASDAQ) and its front-end system provider (FLEXTRADE) were engaged and working to resolve the issue. Eventually, the PSE was forced to officially cancel the entire day of trading. As of this writing, there was no word from the PSE as to whether or not the problem had been resolved, but I did see that the exchange was looking to conduct a “sanity check” at 8am this morning with the brokers.
>    - ***MB:*** *Jokes aside, problems like these happen from time to time, and it’s commendable for Mr. Monzon to provide the level of transparency that he did in the issue-finding phase of the problem-resolution process. That doesn’t help the frustration and confusion caused by the problem, but it might help temper the staying-power of those feelings should the fix prove to be effective. All bets are off if the problem remains for a second day, or as a sporadic problem that the exchange, its brokers, and all of us as traders must deal with going forward. Knowing how frustrated I get when I lose internet connectivity, and how quickly that rage builds as I run a speedtest, reset my router, reset my laptop, reset my networking card, test connectivity through tethering, and all the rest, I could only imagine how the front-line IT team must feel under the weight of this kind of outage. The only thing that I’m left to wonder is this: what if it was only 41 brokers that couldn’t access the system? Would the PSE have still opened for the day, with potentially hundreds of thousands of accounts stuck off-line? I’m glad the rule system worked to produce a good outcome this time, but it feels like a potentially disastrous situation that trading might have been permitted if just 2 more of those affected brokers had been able to access the system. Feels like an interesting thought experiment: assuming the impossibility of building a perfect system, what level of dysfunction should be considered “normal”, and what level of dysfunction should be considered “halt-worthy”? Not an easy question to answer, if you really sit down and give it a minute of thought, which I did, considering I didn’t get to do any trades!*

>- **[NEWS]    A closer look at broker/analyst predictions...** As market veterans will know, December and January are traditionally when brokers and analysts emerge from their 6-screen trading dens to speak with someone in the media and make bold predictions about what the PSE will do over the coming year. In years past, this exercise was known as the “plus 10”, because it seemed like everyone was just taking whatever happened in the previous year, and adding 10% to the total. “Thanks” to COVID, I’ve heard many say that the “plus 10” is dead (for now), but that the genetic, instinctual urge for brokers and analysts to make a prediction -- any prediction -- is still powerful enough to draw these creatures out of their dens to make predictions despite the massive swirling soup of variables that lay before us. But is it dead? Sun Life [predicted](https://twitter.com/Philbizwatcher/status/1469140342188691458) 7,900 by the end of 2022 (+12% from Monday’s close), AIA Asset Management [predicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XjEiTzPOUA) 7,800 (+11%), Trading Edge Consultancy [predicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUlu-61i14U) 9,000 by mid-2022 (+28%), and COL Financial [predicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhmPrmiuF0g) 7,800 to 8,000 by end of 2022 (+11% to +14%). Aside from Trading Edge Consultancy’s superbull take, everything else seems to be playing in the Plus 10 sandbox, give or take a few points. Now, given that, how reliable are these estimates? Well, let’s take a look at what people were saying at the end of 2020 about what our exchange would look like today. Sun Life [expected](https://www.moneysense.com.ph/sun-life-expects-pse-index-to-hit-8000-in-2021-gdp-to-post-4-5-growth/) the PSE to end 2021 at 8,000 (off by 11%). ATR Asset Management [expected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXV--WmYXm8) 8,300 by the end of 2021 (14% miss). BDO [expected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnWDZVMGO6E) 8,000 (11% miss). Macquarie [said](https://business.inquirer.net/328068/psei-seen-to-post-strong-rebound-by-year-end) 7,700 (8% miss).
>    - ***MB:*** *The point of this article isn’t to laugh at predictions that didn’t come to pass. The point is to underline the uncertainty of the future. Nobody has any idea of what will actually happen, but every single person has at least a light framework of inputs (inflation, COVID status, economic activity, weather, election outcome, etc) and a faint glimmer of the future configuration of the economy that might result from their opinion of where all of those sliders will be set for this year. The predictions are based on a snapshot in time of those sliders (like in a game’s Gameplay Settings menu), based on the information available at the time, and the analyst’s research and opinions on how specific trends may break for certain companies, sectors, or the economy as a whole. Short-term traders (day traders, swing traders) probably don’t care at all about this, but understanding the context for these predictions can be very useful to long-term investors. Take the time to read and listen to these predictions. Find analysts and investment houses that research and communicate the inputs that you consider to be crucial to your investment thesis. Then, consider their prediction to be the 2022 baseline based on the January 1st information. As things change, apply those changes to the analyst’s model (as best as you can understand it), and see for yourself if the predictions hold true. As a long-term investor, I’m less concerned that so-and-so analyst missed her prediction by 15% because “haha she didn’t predict Omicron”, and more tuned in to whether or not her model of how things will proceed in the year was accurate. Maybe the inputs were off. Maybe she didn’t predict some random event. But the crucial bit is this: was the model effective for your investing style? It can be golden to find alignments like this. For some investing styles, and most investing theses, it might be very difficult to find a mainstream analyst that speaks about models that will be applicable, but there’s something to be learned from almost any model you get the opportunity to consume. Keep an open mind, and be open to new ideas and to new ranges of input.*

>- **[Q&A]     Do I need to buy DITO CME [DITO 5.04  unch] shares to avail of the stock rights offering?...** I got this question yesterday, and it’s a good jumping-off point to quickly discuss the ownership aspect of a stock rights offering (SRO) that differentiates it from a regular follow-on offering (FOO), and the related issue of the dreaded “ex-date” and how that applies to SROs in theory and to this particular SRO in practice. Ok, so first, what’s an SRO? Basically, it’s when a company sells a block of shares to raise money, but where it limits the ability to buy these shares to only people who already own the stock itself. With a FOO, anyone can contact their broker and put in a subscription request for the FOO shares, but with an SRO, only those that own the stock can make a subscription request; even then, the shareholder’s ability to buy SRO shares is limited by how many shares they already own. This is called the entitlement ratio, and it governs the number of shares that an eligible purchaser can buy. In DITO’s case, the ratio was set at 1 rights share for every 1.72935 DITO common shares owned. But then the question arises: do you just buy DITO and then buy the rights shares? Not so fast! This brings us to the issue of the ex-date, which in the case of DITO is  (or was) December 20, 2021. The ex-date is the day that the “right” to purchase the SRO shares is no longer attached to the shares, which means that anyone that wanted to avail of the DITO SRO would need to have owned the underlying common shares before the end of trading on Friday, December 17th (in order to own the shares before Monday, December 20th). Shares purchased on the 20th, or after, do not come with the right to purchase SRO shares (they’re “ex”, meaning “without”). So, if you purchased 20,000 shares in November, you’d have the right (but not the obligation) to buy up to 11,565 SRO shares (1 share for every 1.72935 shares owned), but if you bought those 20,000 shares on Monday, January 3, 2022, you’d only own the DITO common shares with no associated rights to purchase the SRO shares.
>    - ***MB:*** *I’ve seen some experienced traders screw up the ex-date, especially ones that are not accustomed to playing IPOs/FOOs/SROs, so cut yourself some slack if you’ve ever encountered any confusion about it. Just remember that the ex-date is not a “do it by the end of this day” kind of deadline, as it is a “if you haven’t done it by this day you’re out of luck” kind of deadline. That said, unless you’re sitting on a pile of DITO shares that you bought before December 20th, you’re just going to be spectating what happens when the SRO shares (₱4.88/share) get listed on January 26th. DITO’s stock price has been steadily falling to meet the SRO price since the price was announced in mid-December, but the truth is that that may just be a continuation of the 10-month fall that started in February. It will still be interesting to see what happens to the price once the new shares are listed. What’s going to happen next is a complete unknown to me. Now that foreign companies can own up to 100% of telecommunications companies like Dito Telecommunity, does that provide an opportunity for China Telecom to increase its stake in Dito Telecommunity directly? If so, would it buy primary shares from Dito Telecommunity or secondary shares from Dennis Uy’s companies? Lots of interesting, completely-speculative wrinkles to explore.*

I wasn’t mad at all, not even irritated. This is because, unlike Sky, Globe, Smart et al, the PSE was transparent and because they are not out very often. Unlike the aforementioned ‘tech’ companies, who are also very cagey about why they’re out.  Something I’ve learned to like Dennis Anthony Uy (Twitter account) for as well - the transparency of Converge - and I’m not a customer, because they don’t serve my area.

Rant over.

#The PSE lost 178 points (!!) to 6731 ▼2.6%

Last week was a painful one for many Barkadans. I don't have any one-size-fits-all advice, since each of us comes to the market with a different set of circumstances and tolerances. I just think it's smart to be eyes-wide-open with your portfolio. Don't be one of those traders that hides from their portfolio while developing PTSD from price drop notifications.

I've been that trader. 

It doesn't end well. I spent my early years afraid to book a small loss, so I'd hold on and generate even larger losses out of a fear of ""admitting"" a losing trade by selling for a loss. 

My ego got in the way of doing proper portfolio management. Don't let your ego get in the way of your strategy.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]     PSE drops 2.5% to the 6,700 level for the first time in 8 months...** The value of the PSEi dropped by 2.5% to the 6,700 level for the first time since August of last year. The index is down 10% from its 2022 high of 7,502 that we hit back in early February. The last two times the index dropped to this level, it eventually made its way all the way down to the 6,200 level before recovering. Thankfully, the associated recoveries were “V-shaped”, which is a slang financial term for a quick recovery after a quick decline.
>    - ***MB:*** *I guess we’re all just hoping that market conviction returns once the volume comes back, but that might be a little bit of a chicken-and-egg problem because we have a couple of issues on the horizon that might make things interesting. The first is that some traders have enthusiastically adopted the American saying, “Sell in May and go away”, which refers to the perceived underperformance of the market during the May through October period. I know a few people that follow this saying, and I actually know one trader that follows this guide robotically by trading out of their positions on the first trading day in May. Personally, it’s always seemed like a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy to me; a bunch of traders just waiting for the first sign of weakness to unload and run from the market just creates additional weakness that reinforces the belief. From a historical perspective, we don’t even have to look any further than last year to see a time when following the “SIM&GA” saying would have been a mistake, since the market went up over 15% between May and November, with the market going up 5% during the month of May alone. We are also very likely to see the BSP raise interest rates in June. Generally, when the cost of renting money goes up, this puts downward pressure on the potential future cash flows of most companies, and stock prices tend to fall. Rising rates will also make fixed-income products marginally less attractive, like REITs and bonds. The impact isn’t even, and in some cases like banks, rising rates can actually be pretty good for business. Oh, yeah, and that whole election thing. Can’t forget about the election!*

>- **[NEWS]     Ayala Corp declares property dividend of AC Energy shares...** The Ayala Family’s holdco, Ayala Corp [AC 737.50 ▲0.75%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=652101415552d6193470cea4b051ca8f)], declared a property dividend of 3 AC Energy [ACEN 7.22 ▼9.75%] shares for every 1 AC share owned. The Record Date is May 27, but AC said that the actual payment date has yet to be determined, and depends on the completion of AC’s acquisition of the ACEN shares; AC is buying the ACEN shares from AC Energy and Infrastructure Corporation (ACEIC), which is ACEN’s parent company and a wholly-owned AC subsidiary, in a [block sale](https://mb.com.ph/2022/04/29/ayala-corp-shareholders-to-get-acen-shares/) at “prevailing market prices.” AC said that the stock dividend will allow AC shareholders to “directly benefit” from one of AC’s “successful business-building initiatives”, and the transfer of shares from AC to its public shareholders will also allow ACEN to avoid violating the PSE’s 20% minimum public ownership requirement.
>    - ***MB:*** *This feels like a better way to manage potential violations of the minimum public ownership (MPO) requirement, though it’s one that is only really available to publicly-traded companies that have a publicly-traded parent. Instead of going through all the hassle of setting up a stock rights offering (SRO) or follow-on offering (FOO), the parent company just releases some of the subsidiary’s stock to its shareholders, and the deed is done. The move doesn’t fit every situation, and the PSE is probably disappointed to miss out on the juicy listing fees that it could have snagged if the Ayalas elected to conduct an SRO or FOO instead. (Don’t worry about the ol’ PSE too much, it still gets a piece of that block sale.) It doesn’t look like the market was a huge fan of it, though; while shares of AC were up marginally by 0.75%, shares of ACEN were down 9.75%, with all of that drop coming after the disclosure announcing the dividend hit EDGE (the PSE’s public disclosure server) at 1:23pm on Friday. ACEN’s stock is now down 42% over the last 6 months.*

>- **[Q1]     Universal Robina Q1 profit ▲16% y/y, ▲29% q/q...** The Gokongwei Family’s branded consumer food and beverage company made ₱3.5 billion in profit in Q1/22, up 16% from its Q1/21 profit of ₱3.0 billion, and up 29% from Q4/21 profit of ₱2.7 billion. Universal Robina [URC 102.50 ▼3.03%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=58491d1c7c87af643470cea4b051ca8f)] attributed the rebound to the “accelerating momentum of sales” and foreign exchange gains, despite noting the constraints on profitability due to the recent (and prolonged) spike in commodity input prices. URC made a net gain on foreign exchange of ₱273 million this year, up from a net loss of ₱174 million in Q1/21.
>    - ***MB:*** *Inputs are the ingredients that URC uses to make its products, like sugar, palm oil, flour, and skimmed milk powder. These ingredients are essential to the products that URC makes, and if URC is paying more for the ingredients and keeping prices the same, that means they’re making less profit per unit of sales. That’s why URC already [announced in March](https://www.bilyonaryo.com/2022/03/07/price-hikes-coming-lance-gokongwei-to-cut-urcs-costs-by-p1-5b-a-year-amid-surging-commodity-prices/) that it would be raising prices to help offset the rising cost of its commodity inputs due to supply chain issues and inflation, and that it would pair this price increase with a cost-cutting initiative to trim up to ₱1.5 billion per year in costs through the reduction of waste and inefficiencies. URC isn’t the only company in this predicament; most manufacturers and producers in the food and beverage ecosystem have been getting squeezed for the better part of the last two years, with no end in sight. While these periods erode margins and depress profit potential, if I were a URC shareholder, I’d be thankful for the opportunity to observe how the board deals with a crisis like this, and I’d be optimistic about the future profitability of URC as these cost-cutting measures will assist URC’s profitability, thick or thin.*

MWIDE amended its articles of incorporation to specifically exclude the line, “To own, use, improve, develop real estate of all kinds”, because it “does not engage in the business of real estate development”. It would be interesting to know the background on this, since most development companies tend to expand their scope as they grow, not narrow it.

The fundamentals of the banking business are improving: gross loans up 5%, corporate loans up 10%, and total deposits were up 17%.
>    - **BDO** [BDO 130.00 ▼1.96%] [[link](https://business.inquirer.net/346691/bdo-to-issue-phs-first-blue-bonds)] sold US $100 million in “blue” bonds to IFC. These bonds will adhere to green bond principles, and the IFC’s own “blue” bond requirements which are meant to improve ocean health and make ocean-based economies more sustainable. The Philippines is the world’s third-largest ocean polluter. IFC will assist BDO in identifying potential projects that could be financed with these bonds.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[UPDATE]     GCash x PSE initiative will test non-GCash infrastructure...** I received several private notes from Barkadans about the GCash/PSE tie-up story that provided interesting insight into the potential commercial and technical aspects of the deal. One note agreed in principle with the [dissenting opinion](https://business.inquirer.net/362425/gcash-partnership-to-add-millions-of-new-stock-market-investors) of Joseph Roxas, president of Eagle Equities Inc., that GCash’s estimate of being able to provide the PSE with up to 9 million traders within 5 years was likely inaccurate. The reader said that the total addressable market is actually closer to about 5% of GCash’s 67 million users, so roughly about 3.35 million, once the userbase is filtered for sufficient disposable income, interest in investing, and willingness to try something new. A few analysts mentioned that they question the discoverability of the GCash-to-PSE link, based on how cluttered and “everything” GCash’s user interface is already. This was also a common refrain from non-analyst GCash users that wrote in to give their views. Yet another reader with technical experience wrote in to say that GCash’s infrastructure is battle-tested to handle tens of thousands of users sending large batches of small transactions in a short period of time, but “hoped” that the PSE and AB Capital components of the system were similarly tested at such a scale. This reader said that any step in the process belonging to the PSE or AB Capital that remains manual, that isn’t automated, will result in “large” and “painful” bottlenecks.
>    - ***MB:*** *I want everyone to remember that this is all just speculation and opinion at this point. Until the parties provide more information about the nuts and bolts of the system that will support this massive change, we’re just not going to have a solid idea of what to expect on Day 1 when the “Invest” option appears in the GCash app. If even the conservative estimates are true, that 3.35 million GCash users will become PSE investors over 5 years, that’s still 670,000 new investors coming online through AB Capital’s system each year, which is around 30% larger than the number of accounts in COL Financial’s [COL 3.47 ▲0.29%] entire system. That’s nearly half of all PSE accounts, added to the PSE ecosystem, through one broker link, each year, every year. I’m not saying this to be cynical. I think the tie-up will be transformative for the PSE in terms of market inclusion. But I think that when you deal at this kind of scale, all sorts of little things that didn’t matter when they were happening just 10 or 20 times per day start to matter when they’re now happening 10 to 20 times per second. And that kind of readiness is hard to develop, even with advanced testing. I’m confident that GCash is ready, but are the PSE and AB Capital? I’ve reached out to both to learn more, and I hope to be able to relay what I find out to you all very soon.*

>- **[COMING_UP]     A quick look at the week ahead on the PSE...** This is something of a quiet week in terms of company events. The only one I’m tracking on my calendar is the Record Date for the Globe [GLO 2118.00 ▼1.12%] stock rights offering, which is on Wednesday, September 21. As interesting as that is, it’s nothing compared to the weight of what will be decided during the US Fed’s meetings on September 21 and 22. The US market (and probably ours as well) will be treading water until it receives guidance from the Fed on what it will do with rates, and all the data that has been coming out in recent days has certainly raised expectations that the Fed will need to be at least as-aggressive as it has been, if not more aggressive, to contain inflation going forward. The BSP’s interest rate review is scheduled for the following day. It has already said that it will follow in the US Fed’s lead in what it will do to address the problem in our country.
>    - ***MB:*** *The more aggressive the US Fed, the stronger the US Dollar in comparison with pretty much every other currency in the world, including the Philippine Peso, which is sitting just above its all-time valuation low that it set at ₱57.43 on Friday. The take-away for me here is that the central banks are still playing catch-up to whatever is happening, and all that talk about knowing that we’re close to peak inflation might be a little premature. Rising rates will continue to harm fixed-income valuations, like we’ve seen for months in the REIT market, and will strengthen the US Dollar which will only worsen the problems that companies like DITO [DITO 3.60 ▲0.84%] have been facing with their US Dollar-denominated debt.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **The Keepers** [KEEPR 1.27 ▲3.25%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=54ba94c932afe3413470cea4b051ca8f)] suspension was lifted after Lucio Co’s liquor trading company provided substantial disclosure on its acquisition of 50% of the Spanish manufacturer of its most successful product, Alfonso brandy. MB Quick Take: Looks like Lucio Co will pay for this purchase in one big chunk of cash (~₱5 billion) when the deal actually closes, which KEEPR said it expects to happen within the month of September. Investors reacted positively to the news, pushing shares up around 4% in the hours after the suspension was lifted.
>    - **Leisure & Resorts World** [LR 1.79 ▲6.55%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=1294221621a0fc913470cea4b051ca8f)] gets halted briefly after revealing that the LR board approved, in a special meeting on Thursday, the sale of 691,200,000 LR shares by way of private placement, at a price of ₱1.70/share, Clearspring Holdings Corporation (330,600,000 shares), Belvedere Skies Asset Holding Opc (330,600,000 shares), and Tucket Holdings, Inc. (30,000,000 shares). This would raise ₱1.17 billion. MB Quick Take: The sale price was basically pegged right at market, and at a price level that LR hasn’t seen for a full year. It spent a lot of March and April in the ₱1.20/1.30 range. The board has called a special shareholders meeting to have the long list of changes approved, including that name change to “DigiPlus Interactive Corp”, an authorized capital increase, and this private placement sale. With the board’s last minute name-change tinkering, from “DigiPlus Corporation” to “DigiPlus Interactive Corp”, do you think they did it to justify taking DIC as a ticker symbol? Strong corporate troll game.
>    - **Prime Media Holdings** [PRIM 1.60 ▼1.23%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=71dcec69600ef5de3470cea4b051ca8f)] was also halted briefly after it disclosed board approval for what the PSE deemed to be a “quasi-reorganziation”. PRIM plans to drop the par value of its Class A Preferred shares from ₱1.00/share to ₱0.04/share, which PRIM said will result in additional paid-in capital (known in the biz as “APIC”) of ₱13,791,609.60, which PRIM plans to apply to its deficit. MB Quick Take: The real reason for the move is to nuke the foreign investors out, so that PRIM can remain compliant with the requirement that media broadcasters be free of any foreign ownership. While it sounds good to apply the APIC to the deficit, it sounds less impressive when you hear that the deficit is some ₱861 million, and that this maneuver only reduces it by 1.6%. Once the one-hour halt was lifted, trading in PRIM was relatively light and lacked any conviction in either direction.
>    - **Binance** [[link](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/09/15/binance-securing-licenses-from-bsp/)] said that it is in the process of acquiring a company that has both “both Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) and Electronic Money Issuer (EMI) licenses” from the BSP. Binance declined to name the company that it plans to acquire, but there are only 29 EMI license holders, and the BSP has announced a 3-year moratorium on handing out new licenses. Binance said that it was working directly with the BSP on the acquisition, and that the acquisition target was also in contact with the BSP to facilitate the transaction. Binance said that it thinks that there is “high potential in the Philippine market”, and thinks that it could become a worldwide crypto hub in a few years. MB Quick Take: Binance is scrambling to make it legal for Filipinos to send it money. The truth is that none of our home-grown banks, brokerages, or apps can even get within a 100 miles of the service that Binance can provide. Whether it provides that full service to Filipinos is another matter, but for anyone that has traded crypto on Binance’s main app, you know the depth/breadth of their offering. It makes COL’s entire site look like a captcha.

#The PSE lost 116 points (!!) to 6864 ▼1.7%

Yesterday was brutal. I've heard from a lot of investors who are feeling battered, and that are sounding a little helpless. Sounds like a large percentage of people are just not opening up their portfolios to avoid seeing/knowing the bad news. If you're a long-term investor, and nothing has really changed to your thesis or its inputs, forgetting about these near-term price movements might be the best idea. If you're a short-term investor, and got caught in a short-term trade, ignoring the problem is probably the worst thing that you can do. Closing the tab doesn't change the situation.

The bottom-line is that you need to react in accordance with your strategy/approach, and evaluate the situation with as little emotion as possible.

>- **[NEWS]     AREIT drops more than 6% after Ayala Land sells ₱3.5 billion worth of the REIT at a discount...** Ayala Land [ALI 34.00 ▼3.41%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=effc12012955b56a3470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed yesterday that it sold 87,370,000 AREIT shares at ₱39.70/share, which was at a 7% discount to AREIT’s previous day close of ₱42.70/share, and at a 24% discount to AREIT’s ₱52.35 all-time high set just two months ago in late February. The transaction was conducted off the exchange through a private block sale to both domestic and American buyers. Since the proceeds of the sale of AREIT shares fall under the REIT Law, ALI will need to incorporate the ₱3.5 billion raised in its upcoming Reinvestment Plan.
>    - ***MB:*** *Monkey see, monkey do? Looks like the market is following in ALI’s footsteps in terms of AREIT’s valuation. We can’t get into the heads of the Ayala Family members to figure out exactly what they’re doing and why they’re selling that stake at this time, but in many ways, “the market” doesn’t really care. If the Ayalas could get more for the shares, they’d have sold the block share sale for more, so the implication here is that the “real” market value of AREIT is probably pretty close to the block sale price. As for why the “real” market value of AREIT might be so low relative to its previous close and its all-time high, well that’s a more interesting question. I saw some analysis yesterday that speculated that REITs might suffer as interest rates rise in accordance with the BSP’s recent signaling that it will raise rates [starting in June](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/04/26/2176916/bsp-likely-raise-rates-june-diokno), and that this will make REIT yields less attractive relative to other fixed-income investment products. The thinking goes that in order for a REIT investor to reallocate their funds to different fixed-income investments, they’d have to sell their REIT shares to do it, and the selling pressure would drop the price. The trick, though, is that as a REIT’s share price drops, its yield will rise, and at some point, that yield begins to look attractive relative to those other fixed-income investment products. REITs may be looking for a new equilibrium. It’s worth watching to see if this will just be a temporary blip for AREIT, or if this is a sign of things to come for the rest of the REIT sector as inflation, and the rate increases designed to control it, become a hotter topic of conversation.*

>- **[NEWS]     Solar Philippines NEC stock price falls below June SRO price range...** Solar Philippines NEC [SPNEC 1.56 ▼8.24%] [[link](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPNEC:PM)] shares fell over 8% yesterday, to a level that we haven’t seen since SPNEC tested the mid ₱1.50s back in mid-March. Volume was heavy, with over ₱162 million in SPNEC shares changing hands. That’s SPNEC’s biggest day by volume in April, and largest by value since March 30. The drop put SPNEC’s market price below the ₱1.60 to ₱1.76 range that SPNEC provided for its [upcoming stock rights offering](https://mb.com.ph/2022/03/28/spnec-sets-p3-3-b-stock-rights-in-june/) (SRO), which it has tentatively scheduled for June. SPNEC was not able to execute an earlier SRO due to the PSE’s rule prohibiting subsequent equity raises within 6 months of a company’s IPO.
>    - ***MB:*** *The stock is now down 33% from its ₱2.32/share all-time high back in early February. Is this just a case of SPNEC getting caught up in the broader movement of the market? It’s not like it was a great day on the market yesterday: “Cement” was the only positive-performing MB Market Sector, and even then it only narrowly avoided finishing in the red. Or is this a sign of something more challenging for SPNEC and its management team? The stock’s price has not performed well since late March, when the company sharpened its plan to conduct the mini-SRO in June, ahead of its planned assets-for-share swap with its parent company, Solar Philippines. Around that time, SPNEC shares were trading for around ₱2.00/share. Yesterday’s little mini-crash puts SPNEC down over 22% from that time, but it’s not like it was doing all that great before yesterday either. Usually, SRO offers are priced at some discount to the prevailing market price as an incentive to existing stockholders to protect their positions from dilution in the face of an SRO, but before yesterday, the price was hovering in the ₱1.70/share range, which is still below the top-end of SPNEC’s SRO pricing range; had SPNEC priced the SRO at ₱1.60, it would still have only been 6% discount to the market prices from earlier this week. Now, the SRO price is at a premium. SPNEC isn’t married to the SRO price range that it provided, it can easily adjust that range to accommodate the changes that have happened, but it’s probably not in the company’s best interests to jump out and make any changes yet that would limit its potential take, in case this truly is just a passing storm.*

>- **[UPDATE]     AC Energy confirms ₱900-B plan, but cautions on uncertainties and timeline...** Earlier in the week, the Manila Bulletin ran an article about comments from AC Energy [ACEN 8.01 ▼2.91%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=cdc1fd5e5c672a003470cea4b051ca8f)] CEO Eric Francia that seemed to indicate that ACEN is planning to spend up to ₱900 billion (~US $18 billion) to develop its pipeline of 18 gigawatts of renewable solar and wind energy projects. The Manila Bulletin quoted Mr. Francia referring to a US $1 million per megawatt “rule of thumb” for the cost of developing its solar and wind projects. In a disclosure yesterday, ACEN confirmed the accuracy of Mr. Francia’s statements, but cautioned that ACEN has not set any capital commitments for its entire 18 GW pipeline of projects, noting that the 18 GW figure includes projects that are in various stages of development that are still subject to “relevant Board and partner approvals”. ACEN reiterated that “some of that will take a long time”.
>    - ***MB:*** *That’s an absolutely bonkers pipeline. We’ve heard Solar Philippines NEC [SPNEC 1.56 ▼8.24%] talking about its own 10 GW pipeline, but even SPNEC would be the first to admit that it has very little interest in actually operating the projects once they’re completed. ACEN’s pipeline is different in that ACEN intends to be the company to fund, develop, own, and operate the projects in its pipeline. I’m not saying that one approach is better than the other, only trying to draw attention to the differences in the approaches. SPNEC’s approach is not nearly as capital-intensive as ACEN’s, as evidenced by ACEN’s plan to spend nearly a trillion pesos to develop its pipeline. SPNEC is framing itself as a solar-themed property developer, while ACEN is more like the renewable energy platform. SPNEC makes its money on the value of its land assets and the development of the projects that SPNEC has permitted to exist on those assets, and ACEN makes its money on the sale of the electricity resulting from the development of those projects.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **AboitizPower** [AP 33.00 ▼2.65%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=059c94396ab03cbd3470cea4b051ca8f)] Q1 consolidated net income ▼53% to ₱2.9 billion. AP blamed the drastically-lower result on outages related to Typhoon Odette, and the high-bar one-off gain AP recognized in Q1/21 resulting from its award of liquidated damages for a contract dispute it won. Without these one-offs, and without Typhoon Odette, AP said that its consolidated net income would only have been down 4% y/y on the quarter. It’s still not a good look if the most curated alternate reality that AP can come up with is still worse.
>    - **Wilcon** [WLCON 28.00 ▼1.75%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=b960677c1083ac2d3470cea4b051ca8f)] Q1 profit ▲41% y/y, ▲23% q/q, to ₱850 million, on 8.6% same-store sales growth and contributions from new stores. WLCON said that it was still on-track to achieve its target of 100 stores by 2025.
>    - **Alliance Global** [AGI 12.20 ▲0.66%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ac84844bc34ade2f3470cea4b051ca8f)] FY21 profit ▲132% to ₱23.8 billion, which AGI credits to its “diversified portfolio”, “hefty growth in the topline”, coupled with COVID-era “cost efficiency measures” which have remained in place. ANDREW TAN’S AGI [emphasis copied from AGI press release] is well-placed in several industries that will continue to benefit from a widening recovery.

>- **[NEWS]     ABS-CBN halted after it acquired a huge stake in TV5...** ABS-CBN [ABS 11.98 ▲5.09%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=8852ad0b61ee23053470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed that it signed a deal with TV5 to purchase 34.99% of TV5’s common stock for ₱2.16 billion, plus a convertible note worth ₱1.84 billion that converts into common shares after 8 years and gives ABS an interest in TV5’s common stock that will cap out at 49.92%. All of the shares acquired by ABS were primary, meaning that the money paid by ABS will go directly to TV5, not TV5’s shareholders, to fund TV5’s capital and operational expenditures. The companies were careful to highlight that the deal does not pass control of TV5 and its franchise to ABS, as MediaQuest and PLDT [TEL 1811.00 ▲1.74%] will still retain ultimate control of the company, even if ABS converts its note to common shares in 8 years’ time. Commissioner Gamaliel Cordoba, head of the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), said that ABS would have to “clear violations and obligations” before proceeding with its investment in TV5.
>    - ***MB:*** *Given the incredible amount of political capital that Duterte and his allies spent to have ABS’s franchise renewal hopes killed, it’s not surprising to see and hear the breathless opposition to this deal coming out of the woodwork from the moment the acquisition was announced. What happened to ABS was entirely political, and what will happen to it going forward will, unfortunately, also be entirely political. From a business perspective, this is the right move for ABS. It has a huge catalog of content that it is still struggling to monetize at any rate close to what it once did, and a current stable of talent and production staff capable of churning out current and live TV on a national scale. This kind of deal gets ABS one step closer to getting its content back in front of Filipino audiences, and more importantly to shareholders, gives ABS the chance to profit from the sale of ads. We don’t have insight into how ad sales will be dealt with by TV5, but that has to be a massive component of the deal signed between the two companies. There’s a lot of political junk to come that will make this story linger for some time yet.*

>- **[Q2]     Converge Q2 profit ▲16% y/y,...** Converge [CNVRG 20.95 ▲3.20%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=2ac2de5318b9f7cd3470cea4b051ca8f)] Q2 net income was ₱1.98 billion, up 16% from Q2/21 profit of ₱1.7 billion, and up just 1% from Q1/22 profit of ₱1.97 billion. CNVRG’s subscriber count increased to 1,817,115, but the rate of that quarter-on-quarter increase has slowed considerably, from 7% in Q1 to just 1% in Q2. CNVRG thinks that it will reach 2 million subscribers by the end of the year. CNVRG execs said that some of its market sectors were “prone to certain shocks”, implying that cost inflation may have played a significant role in the dramatic slowdown that CNVRG has seen so far this year. The company downgraded its own revenue growth projections for 2022 to just 25-30%, down from the original 50%, saying that “it’s hard to be overly bullish given the reality of what we see today”. While its Q2 performance is not the kind of “hypergrowth” result that the market is accustomed to seeing from CNVRG, the exec team said that it still represents “very solid revenue growth”.
>    - ***MB:*** *It’s not often that one could look at a wildly profitable business that is still undergoing double-digit quarterly growth and think, “man, they’ve had a super tough year”, but that’s exactly what I thought when I saw the earnings report and the quotes from CNVRG’s management team. It’s clear that they are looking at the numbers and are worried about what the rest of the year has in store. CNVRG added just 15,000 customers in Q2, and for the company to reach 2 million by the end of 2022, it needs to add another 183,000. That’s a quarterly average of around 91,500 new subscribers, which would normally have been an easy target for the company to hit, but that Q2 subscriber add is shockingly low. Average revenue per user (ARPU) is also in the process of tanking, having fallen from ₱18,247 in Q2/21 to just ₱11,114 in Q2/22. That’s a 39% drop. So, the company is still growing, still adding subscribers, and still generating more profit, but the amount of new subscribers has slowed dramatically, and the amount of profit it takes from each of its existing customers has fallen almost 40% over the past year. Maybe there will be an uptick as schools start up again for Q3, but it’s pretty worrying to see “inflation” causing this much demand destruction for something as basic and productive as home broadband internet. Is CNVRG the dead canary that the rest of the market should be paying attention to, or is it just an odd result that will stand on its own as the funny confluence of so many complicated factors? The stock is down 23% since this time last year, and down 48% from its October high of almost ₱40/share.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **2GO Group** [2GO 6.60 ▲4.10%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=672b0de3a2ad41573470cea4b051ca8f)] Q2 net income Q2 profit ▲135% y/y to ₱108 million, on significant growth in topline shipping and logistics revenue, and effective cost control measures to bolster the bottom-line. The SM Investments [SM 845.00 ▲4.45%] subsidiary reported that its H1 shipping revenue was up 67% y/y, with the sub-components of sea freight revenue and passenger revenue up 54% and 155% respectively. The logistics side of the business posted a 22% gain. *MB: Looks like Dennis Uy was forced out of his stake in 2GO just a little bit too early; if he were able to hold on for another quarter, instead of liquidating in late Q1, he’d have been able to sell at the improved valuation of a company that was actually turning a comfortable profit with considerable growth prospects. Perhaps that’s bad logic, though, since 2GO hasn’t turned an H1 profit since Uy bought into 2GO back in 2017. Maybe the Curse of Dennis would have prevented 2GO from having such a glorious Q2 and he’d still be waiting to fire-sale the stake for working capital until this day. The huge uptick in passenger revenue is interesting, and I’d like to see if that is replicated across all passenger ferry companies.*
>    - **Cebu Pacific** [CEB 45.20 ▲5.12%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=76d9035941c1bb603470cea4b051ca8f)] Q2 profit ▲71% y/y, as the company trimmed its Q2 net loss to just ₱1.6 billion, up from the ₱6.5 billion net loss it suffered in Q2/21. CEB reported that flights were up 350%, and passenger volumes were up 562%. These gains were somewhat offset by the ballooning cost of fuel, which pushed CEB’s operating expenses up to ₱16.8 billion, an 85% increase over the same time period last year. CEB says that it remains “cautiously optimistic” that it can return to profitability once domestic demand is “robust” and “international borders continue to open.” *MB: I feel like this is a real result for CEB, not like the “fake” profitability that Philippine Airlines [PAL 6.00 ▲1.69%] posted for Q2 that is dependent on the special negotiated lease holidays that will end in less than a year. So while the company is still losing a crazy amount of money, the trajectory is at least not terrible. Don’t get me wrong: there are still so many problems for commercial air travel that it probably deserves its own dedicated day, but at least the CEB team is doing what it can to position the airline to be in the right configuration assuming there are no more black swans and things reopen in a relatively even fashion.*
>    - **Jollibee** [JFC 233.00 ▲6.88%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=53c91b7a0306dc6b3470cea4b051ca8f)] Q2 profit ▲186% y/y, ▲27% q/q, 1H ▲352% y/y. JFC’s Q2 profit of ₱2.8 billion is a significant step forward both year-on-year, and quarter-on-quarter. Worldwide sales were up in a big way, both system-wide (+44.8%) and same-store (32.6%), with the biggest, most material improvements coming from JFC’s stores here in the Philippines thanks to easing of restrictions and menu price adjustments. JFC’s worst-performing region was China, which delivered a -28.1% sales growth for the quarter. Overall, JFC did over ₱73 billion in Q2 sales, and ₱133 billion in H1 sales, aided by global expansion, acquisitions, and beneficial forex adjustments. *MB: For as valuable as the CBTL acquisition has become, and for as much as JFC’s business model has changed with the addition of new brands, the true strength of the company still lies in its ability to sling chicken and burgers in its backyard. As Philippine demand continues to recover, JFC and its shareholders should also continue to reap the benefits of all the money moves that JFC has been making throughout the pandemic. It’s hard to say exactly which quarter we’ll be able to look at JFC’s financials to see what it actually looks like when it's firing on all cylinders, but I get the impression that it depends more on what’s happening in China than on anything else.*

There are not many ports that can hide from a day like that. 

As usual, the key is to remember your investment time-frame, and to consider if anything has changed in the thesis that prompted your investment(s) in the first place.

If you bought on a thesis of middle-class expansion, and that the time-frame for that thesis would be 3-5 years, then a day like yesterday is barely a blip on your radar. It sucks to see red all over the portfolio, but you're not panic-selling and converting potential losses to actual losses.

If you bought on a thesis of ""the Russian invasion of Ukraine will resolve quickly"", and your time-frame for that thesis was ""last week"", well... that's a different story. Commodity prices don't seem to be calming down, and the impact of those prices on the economy and inflation will probably stick around for a lot longer than originally thought. 

Thanks to **ACT**, /u/PHValueInvestor, and /u/tekwani99 for alerting me to an error in yesterday's P/E calculation for **Bank of Commerce** [BNCOM], and to **Will Cabangon** for providing a little context to why BNCOM is conducting an IPO (it's to comply with conditions asserted as part of the BSP's issuance of a universal banking license to BNCOM).

>- **[NEWS]     Integrated Micro-Electronics [IMI 8.47 ▼0.35%] factories in Shenzhen closed for COVID lockdown...** The Ayala Family-owned electronics manufacturer [said yesterday](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=08f2787e0a7eb2b33470cea4b051ca8f) that its factories in Shenzhen, which contribute around 10% to IMI’s annual revenues, will be closed until at least March 20 due to the lockdown of all non-essential businesses in the city to combat a recent spike in COVID cases. Shenzhen is a city with over 17 million residents (more than the official Metro Manila count), and as a [tech and manufacturing hub](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/14/tech/shenzhen-lockdown-foxconn-operations-intl-hnk/index.html) for many global corporations, a lockdown there could have consequences for supply chains and companies all around the world.
>    - ***MB:*** *It will be interesting to see how the ultra-contagious nature of the Omicron variant and China’s “COVID Zero” policy interact. China has shown its willingness to use heavy-handed measures like lockdowns to combat outbreaks, and we all remember how those policies decimated earnings for businesses that were not deemed essential enough to remain open. We also all remember how lockdowns which were intended to last only one or two weeks can easily be extended indefinitely, depending on how the containment measures of the government work (or don’t). One week is probably not a huge deal to IMI, but the possibility of lockdowns increases the risk of supply chain interruptions and logistics issues even if the factory doors are open and regular working hours are restored. Other PSE companies have considerable exposure to China, like Jollibee [JFC 218.40 ▼5.04%], and are also not likely to remain open during any kind of lockdown. JFC has a few locations in Shenzhen that will be affected, but again, a week is probably not a big deal. All eyes will be on how China administers the lockdowns. If the Shenzhen lockdown gets extended, or lockdowns are announced in any other major cities, it might be time to reassess projections for companies with significant exposure to China.*

>- **[NEWS]     Figaro Coffee [FCG 0.54 ▼8.47%] presents one new Cebu location as evidence of “ongoing expansion”...** The fast food holding company, owned by Jerry Liu through his personal holding company, Camerton Inc., put out a [press release yesterday](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=62861e5abb0cbf1a3470cea4b051ca8f) to pump its “ongoing expansion in 2022”. FCG referred to itself as a “fast-growing local food conglomerate”, but the entire press release only talks about one new Angel’s Pizza location in Cebu (bringing its total locations in Cebu up to three). At the time of FCG’s IPO in January, the prospectus said that it would use the proceeds of the IPO to open 35 new Angel’s Pizza locations over the next 36 months: an average of approximately one location per month.
>    - ***MB:*** *Growth is good, and opening new stores is vital for FCG, both from a growth/survival perspective, but also from a “executing the plan we sold to investors” perspective. There are a few PSE companies that make a big deal out of nearly every new store opening, such as Manny Villar’s AllDay Marts [ALLDY 0.44 ▼6.38%], so there’s certainly room for FCG to celebrate its win through a press release like this. What gets me, though, is the way the release tries to spin the opening of a single location as evidence of its ongoing expansion. I mean, sure, technically, opening one location is evidence of expansion. But it’s like the first teeny tiny step on a three-year plan of building over 60 locations across four brands all over the country. Is one location really evidence of ongoing expansion in that context? I’d rather hear more about FCG’s hard data on the increase in foot traffic that it mentions so that we could form reasonable expectations about forward earnings, or hear about whether FCG is ahead or behind schedule in its expansion efforts. It feels petty to even talk about this, but this kind of thing is a problem that I’ve had with this group’s messaging for years. To anyone familiar with Mr. Liu’s other company, Cirtek [TECH 3.14 ▼6.55%]: If you know, you know.*

>- **[NEWS]     CTS Global [CTS pre-PSE] has ₱1.37 billion IPO approved by the SEC...** The company bills itself as a local brokerage with experience trading in the PSE and many global markets, like the US, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Japan. CTS is chaired by Edward Lee, who also chairs COL Financial [COL 3.99 ▼0.25%]. The [SEC approved CTS’s application](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/03/14/cts-globals-initial-publicoffering-gets-sec-approval/) to conduct an IPO to sell 1.37 billion common shares at up to ₱1.00/share; CTS plans to use the proceeds to expand its global trading operations and update its client management systems. The offer period is scheduled for March 31 through April 6, with an IPO/listing on April 13. CTS said that it has “consistently generated profits from its assets under management”, but that “overhead expenses” have, up till now, prevented it from “maximiz[ing] its bottomline profit”. CTS plans to deploy the proceeds of the IPO into the “global markets” to take CTS “to the next level”. Currently, CTS has approximately 30 traders managing ₱550 million in funds across all markets.
>    - ***MB:*** *We’ve seen so many SEC-approved IPO schedules get blown up that I’m going to wait for the PSE’s approval to start getting serious about the April 13th IPO date. On some level, the logic employed by CTS is fairly solid: giving more money to the same traders should amplify the returns that those traders have been generating, without having to pay anything in additional salaries. Income goes up, while expenses stay flat. CTS plans to plow the IPO proceeds into global markets to achieve its goal of sourcing at least 75% of its trading revenue from global markets by 2025. The thing that trips me up, though, is that CTS has generated its historic returns mostly in the Philippine market as a Philippine brokerage: 63% of its 2021 trading revenues came from trading the PSE, with only 37% of revenues coming from its activities on the global markets. Through 2018 and 2019, over 82% of its trading revenue came from the Philippine market. In 2020, the distribution was basically even, but as I said, by 2021, the split was again heavily in favor of the Philippine market. Maybe CTS has internal data to validate its global trading self-confidence, but I don’t see a lot of hard information in the prospectus that would help me, the potential investor, gain that similar level of confidence. CTS attributes its trading success to an internally-developed trading system that encompases fundamental analysis, technical analysis, sentiment, and risk management, but these are common components of most software-based trading systems. I feel like I don’t know the hook for this one, yet, so I’m going to stay open-minded and wait to see if CTS updates its prospectus to add more guidance on these issues.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...** (1) Citicore Energy REIT [CREIT 2.61 ▼2.97%] dividend was based on only 2 months of income from Armenia property, and 1 month of income from the Dalayap property. Still waiting for a more-detailed breakdown so that we can properly contextualize the dividend (and peg that yield). (2) Capital Economics [CE] [[link](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/03/14/2167028/gdp-cut-looms-philippines)] cut its projection of PH GDP growth in 2022 to 7.2%, down from 8%, due to “global energy prices” (coal, oil, gas). The higher energy costs also caused CE to increase its inflation projection to 4.3%, up from 4%. CE is an international “independent economic research provider”. (3)  BSP [[link](https://mb.com.ph/2022/03/14/ph-economy-may-be-insulated-from-russia-ukraine-war-bsp/?swcfpc=1)] said that our economy “could” be “insulated” from impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that GDP might only take a 0.1% hit. But Diokno does admit that “conditions have changed”.

>- **[Q2]     DITO CME lost ₱7.3 billion on forex in H1...** DITO CME [DITO 3.76 ▼0.53%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=e2105806284d680f3470cea4b051ca8f)] posted a Q2/22 net loss of ₱8.6 billion, down 292% from its Q2/21 net loss of ₱2.2 billion, and down 9% from its Q1/22 net loss of ₱7.9 billion. DITO is the parent company of Dito Tel, but the 3rd telco’s financials were not officially incorporated into DITO’s financial statements until the share-swap was executed in H2 of 2021. Prior to Dito Tel’s inclusion, DITO’s financials were basically the interest that the company made off of extending loans to Dennis Uy’s other companies, like Udenna Corp and Chelsea [C 1.18 unch], while waiting for the share-swap to complete. The result is that year-on-year comparisons of the Q2 and H1 data are basically useless. Of course DITO will show a 957% uptick in H1 revenue; it didn’t really earn anything in H1/21. Of course DITO will show massive upticks in H1 expenses; it didn’t really do anything in H1/21. This means that we need to be looking at quarter-on-quarter data to derive anything interesting about Dito Tel. On a q/q basis, DITO’s ₱8.6 billion net loss is only 9% worse than the ₱7.9 billion loss it posted in Q1. Comparing DITO’s Q1 report to its Q2 report, total revenues are up 27% to ₱1.7 billion, but DITO’s operating loss widened by 0.35% to ₱3.4 billion. General expenses were up 3% to ₱2.9 billion. Interest expense was up 34% to ₱0.8 billion. DITO also revealed that it incurred ₱7.3 billion in unrealized foreign exchange losses in H1, as the value of the Philippine Peso (the currency its customers use to pay for its services) dropped dramatically as compared to the US Dollar and the Chinese Yuan. As of the end of H1, DITO has US $1.16 billion in interest-bearing loans that, at current exchange rates, represent ₱63.9 billion in liabilities. The exact same loan, measured at the end of 2021, represented “only” ₱59.0 billion in liabilities. That’s a net difference of ₱4.9 billion in just 6 months.
>    - ***MB:*** *Those forex losses are startling. When DITO says that the losses are “unrealized”, what it means is that they expect to lose that amount (as of the current exchange rates) as DITO makes its payments on its outstanding debt. The losses will be “realized” when the payments are made, and the foreign exchange difference is felt. It also means that the underlying exchange rates could continue to change to help DITO, or to hurt it even worse. Outside of that unsolved forex problem, Dito Tel’s operating losses are still growing, despite throwing a ton of new subscribers onto its network. While the headline will be distractingly bad, there are two things I liked from an administrative perspective. First, DITO actually referred to Dito Tel as “the Company’s largest investment” in the first paragraph of its Management Discussion section (the only change in the paragraph from Q1). Second, DITO revealed that its average revenue per unit (ARPU) for H1 was ₱81. ARPU is a basic telecommunications metric that measures the profitability of a company’s users, and this was the first time that DITO has publicly used this metric in its earnings reports. Is this a good result for DITO? No, but operations are not as bad as the headline losses could make you think. I mean, they’re not good. And DITO still has a massive amount of forex exposure risk, but the operating loss basically flatlined while going from 5 million subscribers at the start of Q1 to 9.6 million at the end of Q2. In a sea of red, that’s something to work with.*

>- **[UPDATE]     VistaREIT dividend was a combination of a special and regular Q2 dividend...** The VistaREIT [VREIT 1.74 ▼0.57%] Investor Relations department confirmed to me that the VREIT Q2 div was actually a combination of a special dividend (₱112 million) from income generated from May 1 through June 14, and a regular dividend (₱45,100,616) from income generated in the final half of June, from June 15 through to VREIT’s listing on June 30. The IR department also updated VREIT’s occupancy rate to 97% (up from 91%), and its WALE to 4.1 years (down from 5.1 years).
>    - ***MB:*** *Thanks to the VREIT IR department for their quick response, and for wishing me good “VHealth”. Haha. Let’s forget about the “special” part of this dividend for a second, and just focus on the “regular” component to see how VREIT’s first dividend compares to its REIT Plan guidance of an 8.25% yield (based on the IPO offer price of ₱1.75/share). If the regular dividend represents (roughly) what shareholders get from half of a month’s distributable income (~₱0.006/share), then we could annualize this amount by multiplying it by 24 (the number of half-months in a year) to get a full-year dividend of ₱0.1443/share, which, at VREIT’s IPO price, represents an estimate annual yield of 8.24%, right in-line with VREIT’s guidance.*

>- **[CORRECTION]     JG Summit’s Q2 net income didn’t drop 95%...** it went up 335%!... Yesterday, my headline reported that JG Summit [JGS 55.60 ▲1.00%] [[link](https://mailchi.mp/e5fb1f88f32a/jg-summit-q2-profit-down-95-yy-h1-is-worse?e=933945058a)] had delivered a Q2 net income of only ₱44 million, which I said was a 95% drop from its Q2/21 net income of ₱815 million. That’s not even close to correct. My script took the “net income attributable” line from JGS’s 17Q earnings report instead of the “net income after taxes” line, and in a rush, I wasn’t critical enough of that to spot the mistake. My breakdown of the individual business units is still accurate, as is (I believe) my analysis of how exposed JGS is to inflation and the second-order effects of it, but my headline and the summary numbers about the quarter were just completely off. I called JGS’s quarter a “dog’s breakfast”, but maybe the real dog’s breakfast was my write-up, and JGS’s quarterly report was just more or less “fine”, but with several worrying points of vulnerability to continued inflationary pressures.

Some days, I feel like a guy surrounded by hundreds of scripts in various states of disrepair, but for some reason on this day I decided to just John Daly the results of my scripts (just “grip it and rip it”) without taking a closer look. Seems like my upcoming break will be the perfect opportunity for me to take a deep dive into my own Google Sheets logic and Python code. Don't feel bad for me, I love it so much. But sometimes I let myself live with """"mostly working"""" code for too long, and this error tells me that I need to make a few improvements!*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **CTS Global** [CTS 1.09 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=8131f1a72972ebda3470cea4b051ca8f)] H1 net income up 74% y/y on unrealized foreign exchange gains. CTS said that its H1 global trading revenue fell 53% y/y to ₱28.3 million, and that its local trading revenue fell 46% to ₱20.2 million, for a combined drop of 41% y/y. While trading revenues are down, CTS noted that it had an unrealized foreign exchange gain of ₱44.2 million in H1 that saved its weak trading performance by boosting net income significantly. *MB: I don’t think that any of CTS’s IPO investors were clicking “BUY” with the thought of sweet unrealized foreign exchange gains and income from low-risk government debt instruments dancing through their heads, but here we are. Remove the ₱44.9 million in foreign exchange gains from H1/22 and the ₱3.8 million in foreign exchange gains from H1/21, and the picture looks dramatically different: H1/22 core net income of ₱5 million, down 80% from its H1/21 core net income of ₱24.9 million. That’s abysmal. It’s even worse if we isolate for Q2: core net loss of ₱6.6 million, down 8,150% from its Q2/21 core net loss of ₱0.08 million.*
>    - **COL Financial** [COL 3.51 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=1a23f47b4567c7a63470cea4b051ca8f)] Q2 profit ▼57% y/y, ▼46% q/q, to ₱49 million, with 1H profit ▼71% y/y to ₱140 million. COL blamed the huge drop in profitability on a “significant drop in commission revenues”, and the lack of non-recurring revenue from the sale of financial assets in H1/22. COL saw an 8% increase in the number of new customer accounts, bringing its total to ~507,000, but noted a 9% drop in net customer equity to ₱102 billion. COL also noted that the PSE itself was down 13.6% during H1, and that the average daily turnover fell 16.6% y/y to ₱7.5 billion. *MB: The previous year, COL’s H1 account growth was 23% y/y, and its net customer equity growth was 53% y/y. This year’s numbers are tiny in comparison. While overall market sentiment is important to COL's possible earnings, I don’t agree with COL trying to make some kind of “high bar effect” argument about the impact of its sale of financial assets in H1/21 somehow making its H1/22 look that much worse. The revenue COL recognized in H1/21 on the sale of those assets was just ₱55 million, which was just 6.7% of its total H1 revenue that year. Take those sales out, and COL still made ₱424 million in profit in H1/21, and its H1/22 performance is still 67% lower. If I were a COL shareholder, I’d be wondering why the company hasn’t done more to appeal to the masses that flocked to its system during the crypto frenzy and basurapalooza of late 2020 and early 2021.*
>    - **AllDay Marts** [ALLDY 0.35 ▼4.05%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=f0dda8269ca7ad3d3470cea4b051ca8f)] Q2 profit ▼19% y/y, ▲215% q/q, to ₱87 million, with 1H profit ▼94% y/y to ₱11 million, largely due to ₱170 million in losses related to the Alabang fire in January. Operationally, ALLDY noted a marginal 2.2% y/y improvement in H1 sales, but that was considerably less than the 20% y/y sales increase it noted last year. Finance costs were lowered 70% to ₱10 million due to “loan settlements” made using proceeds of ALLDY’s 2021 IPO. *MB: Forget for a second that the fire never happened. I don’t know if I’m able to patch up the lost sales and opportunity cost of the ₱170 million spent on dealing with the lost inventory and damage to the property, but just dump that ₱170 back into the Q2 and H1 financials; nothing happens to Q2 (the fire was in Q1), but the H1 results actually improve so much, from down 94% to up 1% y/y. Yes, Q2 is still a “thing”; if we put the ₱170 million back into Q1, that puts the net income there up to around ₱95 million, and that leaves Q2 down 19% y/y and down 8% q/q. Not the best trend for a consumer-facing business in the midst of a consumer-facing business recovery, where the stock price is down 40% from its IPO price and down 25% since the start of Q2.*

  *** PROGRAMMING NOTE ***    Some Barkadans noticed the new MB Index that I'm tracking and reached out to ask for more information. Truth is, I added it to my tracking scripts but entirely forgot to formally introduce it! So here it goes: I'm now tracking a sub-index of mining stocks, called **Hedgy Metal**, to track the performance of various metal miners as a potential store of value hedge against inflation. The idea comes from Barkadan **Andrew Yap**, and is inspired by metal's reputation as an inflation hedge, and by the recent government policy shift that appears to favor mining's expansion as a sector. The initial components of the Hedgy Metal Index are: **Nickel Asia** [NIKL 5.87 ▲4.63%], **Global Ferronickel** [FNI 2.26 ▲4.15%], **Atlas Consolidated** [AT 6.00 ▼2.76%], **Philex Mining** [PX 5.45 ▲0.37%], **Apex Mining** [APX 1.65 ▼0.60%], and **Lepanto Consolidated** [LC 0.14 ▼0.72%]. 

I do not have a lot of experience covering mining stocks, so I'm excited to gain some familiarity with the sector by tracking this new basket of stocks. Thanks to Andrew Yap for the suggest, explanation, and proposed sectoral composition. If you have feedback on this new index, or have a suggestion for a new index that I could create, please let me know!

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[UPDATE]     Haus Talk [HTI 1.60 ▲6.67%] gains nearly 7% in respectable debut...** The PSE’s newest real estate developer started the day trading in the red; the first trades came across at ₱1.45/share, which is about 3% down from HTI’s ₱1.50/share offer price. It did not take long for the demand to overtake, though, and sure enough, 45 minutes later, the stock was trading up 10% at ₱1.65. Around 11:45am, the stock hit an intra-day peak at ₱1.73/share (up 15%), before settling back to the ₱1.70/share range. The price fell back as far as ₱1.55/share heading into the close, before a last minute little pump pushed it up to ₱1.60/share. The volume was pretty heavy; HTI was the third-most traded stock on the PSE by value, with over ₱350 million worth of HTI stock changing hands throughout the day.
>    - ***MB:*** *The first few moments were pretty intense, as it looked (for a brief moment) like the stock might slip beneath the waves and test the underwriter’s “no stability fund” strategy. Thankfully for HTI IPO investors, the stock attracted a surprising amount of demand and safely rose clear of its offer price pretty quickly. This is a good result for ICCP, HTI, and all the IPO buyers that backed the stock. It’s also a good result for those (like me) who want to see a future that doesn’t include some kind of silly stability fund requirement. Imagine for a second that HTI pulled a Medilines Distributors [MEDIC 1.18 ▼1.67%] and just absolutely tanked yesterday. The public sentiment wouldn’t have been “HTI and ICCP mispriced IPO”, it probably would have been, “hOw cAn tHe pSe aLlOw tHiS tO hApPeN?” Despite this first day of successful trading, there’s still no guarantee that it’s all up up up from here. While it’s certainly possible for the stock to go on a heater, it’s also possible for the wheels to fall off tomorrow, or later this week, or next week, or next month. Just look at AllDay Marts [ALLDY 0.62 ▼1.59%]: that stock hit the ceiling on its first day (up 50%), but just 6 weeks later the stock was trading below the IPO offer price. The lack of a stability fund wouldn’t be a material problem for HTI unless the price retreated back to the ₱1.50 offer level. Stability funds don’t protect gains, they only attempt to protect IPO buyers from potential losses relative to the IPO price for the first month of trading (which wouldn’t have helped in ALLDY’s case anyway). So, let’s see what happens! Good luck, HTI hodlers.*

>- **[UPDATE]     Metro Pacific Investments [MPI 3.90 ▼1.02%] doesn’t plan Maynilad IPO until it can raise water rates in 2023...** It’s been known for a while now that Maynilad would need to conduct an IPO to satisfy the amended requirements of its “new” water concession contract, but now we have a better idea on a timeframe thanks to statements from Maynilad’s President, Ramoncito Fernandez, who said that there [wouldn’t be an IPO in 2022](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/01/17/2154300/maynilad-ipo-seen-after-next-rebasing-cycle), and that the earliest could only be “after the rate rebasing” or when “the contract and franchise are stable”. Rate rebasing is the process that Maynilad uses to set its water rates; the next rebasing will start midway through this year and result in potentially higher rates by January 2023. Mr. Fernandez did not provide any further guidance on his comment about the stability of the contract and franchise. Under the new water concession contract, Maynilad needs to publicly list at least 30% of its outstanding shares before January 2027.  Maynilad is owned by MPI (~53%) and DMCI [DMC 8.50 ▲2.29%] (25%).
>    - ***MB:*** *It makes sense to me that Maynilad would want to get “credit” for the higher income that would result from the rate rebasing process, as that change in income would have a material impact on its valuation. There’s nothing pushing MPI and DMC to market with Maynilad, except for this legal requirement to list. If we assume that Maynilad will raise its rates in early 2023, it’s not super clear what contract/franchise instability could still prevent the company from listing. Perhaps Mr. Fernandez is talking about the need for it to submit a “revised business plan” to outline its capex and development milestones in order to meet its service level obligations under the new contract. Hard to say. We’ll also have to wait for more information on the details of the listing, like whether the existing shareholders will sell secondary shares, or whether the sale will be primary with proceeds feeding into that proposed capex plan. Will MPI and DMC opt to list Maynilad through a series of obfuscating holdcos, like Henry Sy. Jr. and Robert Coyiuto Jr. did to [side-step the legal requirement](https://mailchi.mp/529ba9294fff/sgps-benefit-under-ngcps-new-div-policy-uncertain?e=933945058a) that they faced to list National Grid Corporation of the Philippines? Will we get the chance to invest directly in Maynilad itself, or will we be stuck holding coupons of ownership in something that owns the thing that owns Maynilad, like we have with Synergy Grid [SGP 13.16 ▲0.46%]? Lots of issues to be resolved here, and I will continue tracking as we learn more.*

>- **[UPDATE]     Xurpas [X 0.47 ▼13.64%] plummets on first day of trading after 15 month suspension...** To nobody’s surprise, X had a rough day yesterday, starting in the red, and ending deeper in the red, as shareholders looked to offload shares of the wayward technology company that had been trapped in the suspended stock for almost 2 years. The company claims to have made significant strides in growing a segment of its business related to its “IT Staff Augmentation” software/service, but it’s nothing like the technology company that it was back in 2017, when it was trading at ₱10.48/share and doing business with the big telcos. Since then, the stock has steadily shed over 95% of its value, so that’s why it was surprising at all when X resumed that long-term slide after being out of commission for so long.
>    - ***MB:*** *Like I mentioned in a [previous post](https://mailchi.mp/6f111a767a72/berjaya-hotel-closure-over-poblacion-girl-thing-immaterial?e=933945058a), I’m not writing the company off. There’s plenty of space in our economy for a technology company to make a service layer of software that helps any one of the booming internet-related business sectors, like BPOs, or even POGOs. Well, maybe the POGO ship has sailed, but the gaming world’s desire to push gambling online is as strong as ever. I don’t have any industry-specific knowledge to know if these sectors are a good fit for what X does, or could do, and frankly, I don’t really have a great incentive to find out. It’s not clear to me what exactly X does to earn the revenue that it’s generating, and it’s not clear to me what it plans to do to grow that revenue. I also struggle, mightily, with the thought of putting money into a company that was so comfortable being suspended for such a long time. Was X just waiting for somebody to notice that it failed to complete the backdoor listing with Wavemaker US? That deal was why it was suspended in the first place, back in September of 2020, but that deal died just 3 months later in December of 2020 when the deadline for moving forward was breached. Why just sit, suspended, for an entire year? It feels like there’s so much more to this story that we don’t know, and until I know more, that’s enough of a red flag for me to look elsewhere.*

**CREIT IPO** rescheduled to Tuesday, February 22! More on that below.

Also, don't look now but **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** are dumping. Is another crypto winter on the horizon? Given the run-up in crypto prices and the explosion in tangentially-related crypto ""assets"" (like NFTs and play-to-earn schemes), there's likely a whole generation of crypto-exposed investors that haven't felt the deep, extended, ""holy god when will this end?"" sting of a real crypto winter.

>- **[IPO]     Balai Ni Fruitas [BALAI 0.75 pre-SEC] applies to SEC for ₱309 million March IPO...** BALAI is a food brand holding company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fruitas [FRUIT 1.23 ▲1.65%], which is also a food brand holding company. BALAI is hoping to raise up to ₱309 million through the sale of 325 million primary and 87 million secondary common shares at ₱0.75/share. The deal is underwritten by FirstMetro Securities, will feature a stabilization fund (no agent selected yet), and if the over-allotment option is fully exercised by FirstMetro, will result in the public owning approximately 27.5% of BALAI on its IPO day. The [prospectus](https://www.balainifruitas.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Balai-ni-Fruitas-Prospectus.pdf) says that BALAI will price the offer on March 7, conduct the offer period from March 16 to March 22, and hold its IPO on March 30.
>  - **The company:** BALAI is a holding company that owns Buko Ni Fruitas, Fruitas House of Desserts, and Balai Pandesal.
>  - **Primary vs secondary shares:** The offer is 79% primary shares and 21% secondary shares, but just under half of the secondary shares on sale will actually be used for the over-allotment option / stabilization fund. Primary shares are “new” shares created by the company, BALAI, and the money raised through their sale goes directly to BALAI’s account for use in growing the business. Secondary shares are already-existing shares owned by some other company or person (in this case, FRUIT), and the money raised through their sale goes to that company or person -- not to BALAI.
>  - **Use of proceeds:** BALAI estimates that it will net around ₱220 million from the IPO, and plans to use 81% of that on “store network expansion” to build 120 locations until the end of 2023. It plans to use roughly 9% of the proceeds on establishing its commissary to support the operations of its three brands. The remaining 9% will go toward “potential acquisitions” of other baked goods businesses.
>  - **IPO tranches:** They’re going with the traditional 70/20/10 split; 70% of the IPO will be dedicated to an institutional tranche, 20% will go to the broker tranche, and 10% is reserved for the PSE EASy tranche. PSE EASy investors are capped at ₱100,000 per subscription request.
>  - **Historical financials:** *This is where things get interesting. BALAI provided financials from 2017 through 2020, with partial data for 2021 covering just the first nine months of the year. BALAI reports its net income in 2017 as ₱13.9 million, which was down to ₱4.5 million in 2018, up to ₱7 million in 2019, and down to a ₱1 million net loss in 2020. So far as BALAI has reported for the first nine months of 2021, it’s recorded a net income of ₱2.3 million; on pace for its second-worst year in the past five that we have data for. BALAI blames COVID for the downturn in 2020, which makes perfect sense and needs not be interrogated too much considering all of our collective experience in analyzing small-format food brand sales drops due to lockdowns and other movement restrictions. That makes sense for 2020, and for part of 2021, but what accounts for the drop from 2017 to 2018? Perhaps it has something to do with BALAI’s store growth between 2017 and 2018, when it expanded from 77 stores to 83 stores. Perhaps not, though, considering the number of stores appears to bounce around a bit, and without too much rhyme or reason; it had 77 stores in 2017, 77 stores in 2018, up to 83 stores in 2019, but down to 74 stores in 2020, and now sitting with 69 stores (nice), but with a confusing new twist of separating out 6 of those stores as “franchise” stores and 63 as owned stores.*
>  - **The ticker symbol:** *The prospectus sadly fails to define the company’s ticker symbol, instead giving us only the placeholder “[•]”. I’ve gone ahead and given the company the ticker, “BALAI”, because: (1) it looks different and sounds cool, (2) it’s a “word” ticker like its parent, FRUIT, and (3) it’s way better than the acronym of its corporate name, “BNF”. Sure, the word might be Malay (“balai” apparently means “house”), but it’s still perfectly representative, so I’m going with that (and I hope they do, too).*
>  - **Next steps:** This is only the application to the SEC, so BALAI will need to get SEC approval first before it can move ahead and actually submit its application to the PSE to list. Whether or not it can accomplish all of that in time to meet its placeholder dates (pricing on March 1 is just a week away) is pretty unlikely, but weirder things have happened. I’m also wondering if the PSE (the exchange, not the traders) can emotionally handle three IPOs happening within an 8-day span.
>  - ***MB:*** *I’m not sure how I feel about baby BALAI considering that, to me, daddy FRUIT still feels like a work-in-progress. Lester Yu, the owner and CEO of both FRUIT and BALAI, had the misfortune of hitting the market with his food kiosk business just before the greatest medical event of our generation made eating in public seem unthinkable for a huge period of time. I’ve spent plenty of time talking about how I respected Mr. Yu’s pivot away from the kiosk-based nature of FRUIT’s original business plan to adopt an online-friendly platform concept centered around delivery of a diverse “brandscape” of different offerings. I’ve done that so much, in fact, that a few Barkadans have written me personal notes to question whether I’m actually just a shill/hype-man for FRUIT. If I am a shill, I’m the dumbest shill alive, since I’ve done all my shilling without owning a single share of FRUIT or receiving a single peso from the company for any of the nice things that I’ve said about Mr. Yu. All of that aside, everything seems in place for this BALAI offering; it’s got a plan, the plan looks normal, and nothing seems out of the ordinary. It’s not a cash-out. It doesn’t feel outrageous in any way. But maybe that’s part of the problem for me: I don’t feel compelled (from this vantage point) to do anything with all of this information. It doesn’t grab me with grand visions of how BALAI can fit into the future, or coyly reveal a set of financials with escalating profits that imply the company is headed for the moon and I’m a half-second away from missing out. Net profits are frothy and low, with top-line inputs (foot traffic) that are vulnerable to COVID and pandemic-related issues, and bottom-line inputs (cost of raw materials like flour) that are vulnerable to supply chain problems and inflation. It feels like a less-exciting version of FRUIT, which is itself kind of a sinking ship of shareholder value, down some 32% from its pre-Delta variant high of ₱1.82/share, and down 27% from its 2019 IPO price of ₱1.68/share. It’s only up 17% from the very depths of the 2020 COVID crash.*

>- **[UPDATE]  Citicore Energy REIT [CREIT 2.55 pre-IPO] will finally have its IPO this Tuesday...** After weathering a few days of uncertainty, CREIT and the Megawide [MWIDE 5.45 ▼0.73%] ownership group will finally be able to plan the IPO party with some confidence, as the PSE has approved CREIT’s IPO for this Tuesday, February 22. That’s five days later than the originally-scheduled IPO date. We don’t have any additional information on the cause of the delay, only that there was some issue between the receiving agent, the underwriter, and the Philippine Depository & Trust Corporation. Zooming out, we also don’t know if the parties involved have figured out a way to keep this from happening again to any of the REIT IPOs that are tentatively planned for this year, like the CentralHub, the Jollibee [JFC 247.00 ▼1.98%] and DoubleDragon [DD 10.24 ▲3.33%] industrial REIT, and the Villar Family REIT.
>    - ***MB:*** *I think this is one of those situations where the damage done is hard to see. CREIT will still hold the IPO, the IPO buyers will still get their shares, the PSE will still get its listing fee from CREIT, and the underwriter and all of the other service agents in the deal will still get their fees. But imagine, just for a second, that you’re one of the many investors that was given a partial PSE EASy allocation, told to fetch a physical check from Makati for your refund, and then had to sit and wait while the shares that you paid for remain unlisted for five days beyond the planned IPO date. That’s not a situation that anyone investing in the Philippines should expect to experience simply as a cost of doing business in this market, and yet, here we are. To continue to encourage the wonderful reception that REITs have received from us retail investors, I hope the PSE will soon provide a full accounting of the problems that caused the delay and reveal the immediate steps that it’s taken to fix the problems for next time.*

*nice*

On a serious note, BALAI's valuation seems to be on the high side. BALAI has 1,450,005,000 total shares. At P0.75 per share, BALAI is gonna IPO with a \~P1.08B market cap. That's a \~500 P/E given that they only made 2M in 2021. Their ""Pro forma net tangible book value per Common Share immediately following completion of the Offer"" is at P0.252 per share, which means that their P/BV will be around 3 at IPO. Their current BV per share is P0.133. 

How the hell did they come up with this valuation?",1645401644.0

I've been looking at Balai since a few days ago, I'm no expert, but looking at their prospectus, their key performance indicators in 2021 (ended Sep. 30) seems forced, especially since their debt suddenly shot up. 
 
Looking at their financial position, it looks like their Property and Equipment, and Right of Use of Assets increased, and their liabilities reflect these.

As you said, interesting, but not compelling.

With regards to crypto, this might be a divisive opinion, but I think a crypto winter is due. GPU prices have increased in recent years, to the point where a midrange GPU produced in 2017 has the same price in the used market now. 
 
Not even going to the environmental cost, but the outlook that it is a giant ponzi scheme seems more prevalent, as crypto's value is based on the price that someone is willing to pay.",1645401644.0

Slow days are better than low days, so I'll take it.

My non-expert feeling is that our market is going to be looking to be waiting on external factors for direction (inflation, Russia/Ukraine escalation, China's economic figures, etc), but may react negatively if Q3 earnings show signs of weakness.

>- **[NEWS]     MacroAsia plans to sell itself fixed-line internet services in 3-5 years...** MacroAsia [MAC 4.47 ▲2.29%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ce41d5af9a5b73ea3470cea4b051ca8f)], Lucio Tan’s infrastructure development company, announced plans to offer fixed-line internet connectivity through its subsidiary, TERA Information and Connectivity Solutions (TERA), to both residential and business customers, sometime within the next three to five years. MAC has teamed up with Gur Lavi (GLC), a VOIP-solutions provider. MAC clarified that it is developing these services for itself and its JV partners to use, to “meet business requirements, boost connectivity and reduce costs” through offering internet connectivity services in-house. MAC said that it is considering laying down fiber-optic cabling as it expands its water infrastructure network outside of Metro Manila.
>    - ***MB:*** *It’s not everyday that a business group plans to roll its own ISP just to cut costs. That’s not usually how it works. As we’ve seen with Converge [CNVRG 12.80 ▲2.40%], it is expensive and time-consuming to expand a fixed-line internet network, and unless everything that MAC wants to connect exists in a neatly-configured grouping, it’s going to be a pretty random patchwork of area that TERA will cover. Still, it might be kind of wild for anyone who lives in the province around one of MAC’s water projects to receive connectivity services through LucioNet. Lots of variables here that could dramatically change these plans, and the agreement between MAC and GLC is still only in the non-binding MOU phase. Maybe there’ll be some noteworthy movement once that agreement gets upgraded.*

>- **[NEWS]     Semirara Mining & Power declares highest-ever special cash dividend...** The board of directors for Semirara Mining & Power [SCC 41.50 ▲2.47%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=d335d2d293f4ad583470cea4b051ca8f)] voted to declare a ₱3.50/share special cash dividend, payable on November 15, with an ex-date of October 26. SCC said that this special dividend was 100% higher than the special dividend that it announced last year. SCC also noted that the combined special and regular dividends will total ₱5.00 per share in 2022, which is “the highest in its corporate history”.
>    - ***MB:*** *Right place, right time. Well, not really for Ukrainians, or the rest of the world, but for owners of a company that mines coal and sells electricity, times couldn’t be better. The Consunji Family has been milking this cash cow for a while now, but investors have had the opportunity to profit right alongside the family, as the stock price has basically been on fire since August of 2020 when it closed at a 5-year low of ₱9.04/share. It’s gone up 360% in the two years that have followed, all while declaring some of the fattest dividends in recent PSE memory. In May, the family tried to throw some cold water on SCC’s record-breaking performance by casting some doubt on the stability of the coal price going forward. Those remarks were made after coal’s price fell 25%. Since then, however, the price of coal has fully recovered and has plateaued at a choppy (but obscenely profitable) level.*

>- **[NOTES] Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **DITO CME [DITO 2.46 ▼5.75%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=a44bdbcc5539d5e93470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed that Dennis Uy had to sell 500,000 shares of DITO in order to lift DITO’s public float up to meet the 20% minimum threshold. The shares were sold by Mr. Uy’s private holding company, Udenna Corp., for ₱2.60/share. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *That price is DITO’s 52-week low, and it’s a level that the stock hasn’t seen since June of 2020. Since mid-2018, the stock price has only been this low for about four months (February through May) around the time of the initial COVID lockdown. While the transaction is minuscule in the grand scheme of things, it’s just another kick to the jellies for Mr. Uy to be selling shares from this position of price weakness.*
>    - **Haus Talk [HTI 0.80 ▲5.26%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=2f9851a4e0e8e0223470cea4b051ca8f)] board approves retargeting of IPO proceeds. The board decided to cancel the purchase of 7.8 hectares of property in Calasiao and Sta. Rosa, and divert the ₱62 million that HTI had set aside in its prospectus for this ~₱300 million purchase to instead be used as “additional partial payment” for the purchase of a 12 hectare lot in Biñan, Laguna, worth ₱720 million. The HTI board referred to this as a “refocus” of proceeds to its “more prime” projects. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *That’s one way of framing the cancellation of projects, I guess. HTI shareholders lose access to the ₱2.1 billion in revenue that HTI estimated it would receive for building “economic residential housing” on those 7.8 hectares. Don’t get me wrong, the whole point of the HTI IPO was “land acquisition”, and from this perspective, nothing has changed. But this disclosure signals that HTI is cutting projects at a time when rates are rising, and I’m curious to know what has caused HTI to push even more of its chips into this Biñan property. The canceled projects were going to generate ₱2.1 billion on ₱300 million of land costs (7x land cost), while the “more prime” project will generate ₱3.4 billion on ₱720 of land costs (4.7x land cost).*

>    - **Philippine Airlines** [PAL 5.50 ▲0.92%] [[link](https://www.bworldonline.com/corporate/2022/10/17/480937/pal-revises-2022-target-revenues-to-2-6-billion/)] revised its gross revenue estimate for 2022, up from ₱2.0 billion to ₱2.6 billion. PAL already reached its 2022 target of ₱2.0 billion this month, and raised its goal to ₱2.6 billion based on estimates that it would be fully recovered to pre-pandemic domestic capacity by December. International capacity would be 70% recovered by that time, but PAL notes that full recovery depends on a re-opening of routes to China. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *When PAL went bankrupt, the negotiated settlements with all of PAL’s creditors included some “sweetheart” modifications to its plane leases that allowed it to only pay for “time in the air” instead of just a flat lease rate. This deal ends by mid-2023, which means that as heart-warming as these stories of recovery are for PAL, the clock is ticking for the company to not only optimize the routing for its planes, but also maximize the capacity of those routes before the expiration of those lease modifications exposes PAL to the full burden of the lease agreements it signed before COVID. Moment of truth on the horizon. The revised revenue figure is basically equal to PAL’s 2019 gross revenue total. It lost over ₱9 billion that year.*

>- **[NEWS]     Upson International delays ₱4.3-B IPO until Q1/23...** Upson International [OCTGN 5.50 pre-IPO] [[link](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/09/22/upson-postpones-maidenstock-offering-to-q1-2023/)] announced overnight that it was delaying its IPO, which was originally supposed to occur next month, to sometime in the first quarter in 2023. OCTGN said that it wanted to give investors a chance to see the continued sales growth from “return to normal” foot traffic in its 9M/22 financials. OCTGN said that it opened its 200th store in August, which was the 17th new store to begin operations so far in 2022.
>    - ***MB:*** *I get the feeling like this story might be different if the PSE was all 7,400 and “stonks up emoji”, instead of 6,400 and “stonks down”. That said, I don’t know that this is just a differently-worded “market conditions” deferral. Maybe OCTGN has received some pushback on its valuation from anchor investors, who maybe are not willing to accept OCTGN’s projections of continued recovery at face-value. In that case, it really would be in OCTGN’s best interest to hit pause on the process, produce “prove it” financials, and reconnect with those investors to see if the hard 9M numbers make them feel more comfortable about the projections. I don’t have any insider info here, but this kind of thing happens all the time. So yeah, maybe there is an element of OCTGN “reading the room”, but there might also be good reasons (for OCTGN’s owners) to wait a few months to validate some of the projections in the prospectus. The news reports all mention an updated prospectus, but the Upson website still hosts the old August 8 prospectus. I’ll update the tracker when I can cross reference actual data.*

>- **[NEWS]     US Fed raises interest rate by 0.75 percentage points...** The US Federal Reserve [[link](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/20/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-newshtml.html)] decided to raise its target interest rate by 75 basis points to a range of 3.00% to 3.25%, and revealed projections that it expects to raise rates by another 115 to 140 basis points by the end of 2022. The Fed also expected the rate to “top out” at around 4.60% in 2023. The US central bank revealed that it expects year-end economic growth of just 0.2%, and unemployment to rise from today’s 3.7% up to 4.4% in 2023. The Fed also said that inflation will slowly recede back to its target 2% range, but that it does not expect this to occur until 2025.
>    - ***MB:*** *It’s like we took the elevator to the top of Inflation Tower, but are forced to take the stairs back down. What will take 9-12 months to fully form won’t be overcome until some 24 months (or more) after the peak. And that’s assuming that everything kind of proceeds as the US Fed expects that it will. For the next 3 years. While we were all F5ing to get this news, [Russia announced a draft](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/21/europe/ukraine-russian-referendums-intl-hnk/index.html) to draw up an army of 300,000 to mobilize into its failed invasion of Ukraine, and the head of the fixed-income segment at the [Bank of Montreal said](https://financialpost.com/news/economy/99-9-odds-fed-induced-north-america-recession-bmo) that the Fed’s actions put the likelihood of a Fed-caused North American recession at “99.9%”. The DOW crashed 500 points after the rate increase was announced.*

>        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *These little stock dividends are just back-end paperwork to make the financials look better. Still, I’ll watch the day’s liquidity to see what people are doing, but to be honest, LAND is too thinly traded to be of much interest to me. Also, it’s bonkers for LAND to have access to such a broad ticker symbol, when the PSE apparently refused to allow Solar Philippines [SPNEC 1.26 ▼5.26%] to choose the ticker “SOLAR” when SPNEC is clearly the country’s foremost solar-focused company. But... LAND? No offense to LAND, but I’m sure they’d agree.*

>        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *The signals from earlier in this week were that the BSP might only do a 50 basis point raise. While the BSP has been aggressive in recent months, any hesitancy to follow the US Fed’s historic lead will immediately show itself in the currency market. The US Fed’s move will strengthen the US Dollar against all other currencies. The BSP taking a slower approach to raising rates might take some of the pressure off of homeowners and business owners looking to take out loans in the Philippines, but it comes at the cost of the strength of the Philippine Peso and the exchange rate. We’re through the ₱58/$ level, let’s see how long it takes to drop to ₱59/$ on this sad march to ₱60/$.*

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]     PSE suffers a massive drop back below the 7,000 level...** The struggle to retain that “7” is real. The trading yesterday wasn’t panicked exactly, but the mood was definitely red from the start and only got “redder” as the day went on. As one commenter put it, the PSE “started down, but not down down”. And that was true, but stocks just kept losing steadily throughout the day, and closed down over 3.5% right near the session lows. If you do a search on Google, you’ll see “Omicron fears” in all of the headlines, but there’s something else lurking behind all of this: the US Federal Reserve. The US is concerned about inflation, and has signaled that it may be interested to raise rates sooner than anticipated to combat the risk of prolonged, higher-than-optimal inflation. To many traders, the US market acts as a “risk barometer” for global equities; not a perfect signal but definitely something that could help corroborate other trends that traders are seeing in the domestic market.
>    - ***MB:*** *I’ve said in the past, trying to tell why the market does something is tricky business. How much of what happened yesterday was Omicron fear? How much of it is a reaction to the change in US sentiment toward containing inflation? The reality here is that everyone needs to be especially careful about their trades during these times of uncertainty. Yes, there is a great amount of opportunity when things are uncertain, but that opportunity comes with a heightened level of risk. For any traders that got stuck in trades yesterday and are now sitting on losses, make sure that you aren’t still holding on to those losses out of some “hope” that you’ll see a recovery. If the basis of the original trade is dead, you need to take action to limit your risk. Holding indefinitely hoping for an uptick is probably not sustainable in the long-term. The advice is basically the same for long-term investors as well; if these developments and the trends they represent still support the investments that you’ve made, then perhaps you don’t have much work to do and you can wait for these short-term issues to play out.  However, if you made bets on a faster post-delta recovery that hinged on “revenge international travel spending”, you might want to reconsider how both of these trends might impact the medium-term upside and downside of your investment, and see if the cost/benefit is still pointing in the right direction.*

>- **[NEWS]     AREIT [AREIT 43.65 ▼5.93%] releases 3-year investment strategy...** The relatively short [investment strategy document](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=64f48a06e1cbf1055d542af6f1e997b9) (12 pages, including signature page, title page, table of contents, and 2 pages of notices) didn’t have a lot to say that hasn’t already been said, but it did lay it out in a very consumable format that should be quite approachable for anyone interested in AREIT or the REIT sector generally.

>  - **Its goal is to 2x IPO AUM by end 2022:** AREIT said that its goal at IPO was to double its assets under management (AUM) and marketcap, from the initial P30 billion AUM and P33 billion marketcap, to P60 billion AUM and P66 billion marketcap in 2022. According to AREIT, it currently has P53 billion AUM, and according to my most recent quote (taking into consideration yesterday’s bloodbath), it has a marketcap of P66 billion (rounded up). AREIT said that it would achieve its AUM goal by “the end of 2022”.
>  - **Adding assets in 2023/24:** AREIT said that after it achieves its “double-up” goal in 2022, it plans to add 100,000 sqm of gross leasable area (GLA) in 2023 and 2024, which it believes will add between P20 billion and P30 billion AUM to its portfolio by the end of 2024. Banana for scale: AREIT’s current GLA is 344,000 sqm. Not sure what kind of adds AREIT has in mind for 2022 to add at least P7 billion of AUM, but just the planned 2023 and 2024 adds are a 58% increase over its current GLA.
>  - **Funding strategy:** AREIT said that the REIT law allows it to borrow up to 35% of its deposited property value, and that to date it has only borrowed 7.5% of its deposited property value; AREIT can still avail of the additional 80% of this borrowing allowance to fuel future acquisitions from its parent, Ayala Land [ALI 33.20 ▼3.77%] or from third parties. (Let’s be real, though, AREIT’s probably not going to be buying from some non-Ayala firm.) While AREIT has said in the past that it intends to do a follow-on offering at some point and the 3-year plan does mention that equity may be used to finance expansion, it certainly seemed as though AREIT was looking to play down the equity side of the expansion equation in favor of talking up its unavailed debt allowance.
>  - ***MB:*** *AREIT continues to be the yardstick used to measure all Philippine REIT investment opportunities. Nothing in this report to get too excited about, but there’s enough here to definitely keep investors interested in what might be to come. At least AREIT’s talking about acquisitions, portfolio growth, subsequent equity raises, and how it might use its debt to fully leverage its assets under management into dividend yield for investors. (Bagholders of DDMP [DDMPR 1.80  unch] can only hope/wish for such action and a plan as detailed as this.) As of this writing, Taking stock appreciation and dividends together, AREIT IPO holders are up over 70% in the 15 months since its first day of trading. RL Commercial REIT [RCR 7.17 ▼1.78%] and MREIT [MREIT 18.28 ▼0.22%] are up 12% and 15% respectively since their IPOs in mid-September, and Filinvest REIT [FILRT 7.56 ▼1.18%] is up over 11% since August, so it’s not like the rest of the REIT sector has been sitting around underwater like DDMPR has. Still, for those that jumped into this sector rather heavily after the initial success of AREIT (it was up over 25% by the time DDMPR’s offer period started), all this time spent underwater has probably felt like an eternity, despite having been surprisingly short (just 8 months? wow). The REIT sector still faces headwinds, though, and this most recent Omicron variant issue is probably the most pressing. Sure, it looks like all the POGOs that left are being slowly backfilled by BPO firms (this has hurt some REITs worse than others), but the number of BPO workers doing work-from-home has skyrocketed and further trouble from the Omicron variant could aggravate this demand problem for REITs.*

>- **[NEWS]     Suntrust Home Developers [SUN 1.13 ▼8.13%] owner arrested by Macau police for running a cross-border gambling and money-laundering syndicate...** Alvin Chau was [arrested a few days ago by Macao police](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3157657/macau-police-arrest-casino-junket-boss-alvin-chau-10), after an investigation that started in August of 2019 into illegal gambling platforms and money laundering activities. Mr. Chau owns Suncity Group Holdings (halted in Hong Kong), which owns Fortune Noble Limited, which owns 51% of SUN’s outstanding shares. He was referred to by police as the “kingpin” of a scheme to “[set] up of gambling platforms outside Macau and the luring of mainland Chinese into betting illegally online”.  Mr. Chau also has an outstanding warrant of arrest in mainland China, but the Macau police said that their warrant and arrest of Mr. Chau was not related to the warrant issued by China, but that the Macau police have been “cooperating with law enforcement agencies elsewhere to exchange intelligence”.  SUN’s [initial disclosure](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=9c05c2bff483bd845d542af6f1e997b9), released at 10am, only referred to “an announcement in relation to news coverage regarding Mr. Chau”, but a [follow-up an hour later](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=8790b26cf8102d6d5d542af6f1e997b9) got into all the dirty details. Mr. Chau was arrested by Macau police for illegal cross-border gambling activities, that Suncity Group will continue to operate with professional managers despite Mr. Chau’s detention, that the board feels the incident “does not have any direct material adverse impact on the financial position, business or operation” of the businesses, and that Mr. Chau would resign as Chairman and as directors of the various companies.
>    - ***MB:*** *A lot of the reporting around Mr. Chau’s arrest seems to straight-out say that he was arrested for doing what he appears to be currently doing through SUN right now: building offshore gambling platforms in countries near to China that can be used to facilitate the voracious gambling appetites of select wealthy mainland Chinese, either through online gambling (which is illegal) or through in-person junkets (which comes with its own problems). It’s not clear to me how the arrest of Mr. Chau on these charges, and the potential loss of Mr. Chau as a funding source for Suncity Group and SA Holdings (both have massive interests in SUN) do not provide material risk to Suncity Group or SA Holdings. It’s also interesting to me how neither of the disclosures by SUN actually discuss the impact of Mr. Chau’s arrest (and the potential for this arrest to seriously undermine SUN’s business model) on SUN itself; all of the quotes provided seemed more concerned with what happened on the Hong Kong stock exchange to SUN’s ownership group. What about SUN? Are there material risks to its “Chinese gambling junkets” casino resort business plan now that SUN’s owner has been arrested for arranging Chinese gambling junkets?*

>- **[UPDATE]     Globe claps back at DITO, seeks ₱622-M in penalties for “fraudulent calls”...** Globe Telecom [GLO 2032.00 ▼1.84%] [[link](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/08/09/2201433/after-ditos-antitrust-complaint-globe-wants-them-pay-p622-m-penalty)] responded to Dito Telecom’s [DITO 3.76 ▼1.83%] anti-trust complaint with a complaint of its own, this time to the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), and for ₱622 in penalties related to what GLO refers to as “fraudulent calls” that reach GLO subscribers after originating on DITO’s network. GLO said that its users receive over 1,000 such calls per day, and that DITO has not done anything to stop these calls from “bypassing proper voice traffic channels”. GLO is also asking to disconnect its network from DITO until DITO has taken “positive and concrete steps” to stop these calls and pay GLO what it believes it is owed under the terms of the interconnection contracts. This came in response to DITO’s filing of a complaint with the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), which alleged that GLO and SMART [TEL 1749.00 ▲0.34%] were abusing their dominant positions in the industry by preventing a certain percentage of interconnection call traffic. DITO responded to GLO’s compliant to the NTC by claiming that GLO’s complaint was “admission” that GLO was using the threat of disconnection as a negotiating tactic to compel DITO to do things that are unrelated to the interconnection, which DITO claims is a violation of the Philippine Competition Act. DITO also clarified that the fraudulent calls were being placed by “third parties”, such that DITO is also the victim, and then went on to claim that users on the DITO network also received such calls coming from the GLO network.
>    - ***MB:*** *Now this is getting to become a real mess. The amount of the penalty sought by GLO isn’t that large compared to DITO’s ballooning net losses (₱3.6 billion last quarter), but it’s certainly not going to help if the NTC (or any other body) agrees with GLO’s allegations and works to compel DITO to pay the fine. It’s probably dangerous to engage in analysis of DITO’s statements and logic here, but it’s interesting that DITO doesn’t necessarily refute GLO’s accusations about the number of fraudulent calls that are coming from DITO’s network to GLO’s, in fact, DITO itself refers to the calls as fraudulent; DITO’s only real issue here is that it claims to “have data” that shows that it has worked to try to stop the fraudulent calls. I think it’s also kind of cute for DITO to say that interconnection, under the law,  is unrelated to DITO’s inability to stop fraudulent calls from flooding the GLO network. Simple “but for” analysis would show any attorney that we could be dealing with a causative link between interconnection, and GLO’s continued exposure to fraudulent international calls using DITO’s network. All that said, this clash still lacks focus, and that tells me that we’re probably in for another couple rounds of the “he-said-she-said” before something more official happens, like the PCC’s initial response to DITO’s complaint that it must deliver next week.*

>- **[NEWS]     Solar Philippines Nueva Ecija Corp renames itself “SP New Energy Corporation”...** The Solar Philippines NEC [SPNEC 1.74 ▲1.16%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=f2c0541f9d47947e3470cea4b051ca8f)] board voted to change its name to “SP New Energy Corporation” to better reflect the “company’s expansion from a single project in Nueva Ecija, to a portfolio that includes operational projects and other developments.” The name change still requires shareholder approval, and regulatory approval. SPNEC said that it would be “reintroducing” its business to the market “over the coming weeks”, sharing “new details on its portfolio”, and that its stock rights offering would move forward to facilitate the assets-for-shares swap with SPNEC’s parent company, Solar Philippines.
>    - ***MB:*** *Zooming out, it’s a little hilarious that SPNEC is “reintroducing” its business to us, considering it hasn’t even been a year since it “introduced” itself to us the first time. Back then, in December 2021, many (including myself) were excited to see a non-operational renewable energy company use the PSE’s newly-created exception to its listing rules, which normally would have prohibited the listing of an unprofitable or non-operational company, to list SPNEC. Then, all of a sudden, just weeks from its IPO, SPNEC pivoted away from its original plan to just develop the Nueva Ecija project and its expansion(s), and announced plans to download billions and billions of pesos worth of projects from its parent company. Yes, this kind of massive pivot probably requires a name change, but why not call it for what it is: the backdoor listing of Solar Philippines. Well, technically it’s not Solar Philippines the entity, but certainly a huge proportion of its assets. Calling the company the “SP New Energy Corporation” feels like the board twisting itself in a pretzel to fit the existing ticker symbol, “SPNEC”, which (let’s be honest) doesn’t really matter anymore, and ignoring the reality of the assets that it is taking on. Why not just rebrand the company under a cool ticker like “SOLAR”, and then rename the company “Solar Philippines” (or some light variation to distinguish from the existing Solar Philippines entity) and be done with it? Like everyone else, all I can do is sit on the sidelines and try to keep up.*

>    - **Megaworld** [MEG 2.24 ▲0.45%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=6928801d37f74f0b3470cea4b051ca8f)] Q2 profit ▲13% y/y, ▲5% q/q, to ₱3.2 billion, driven by the company’s development arm and its sale of condos. MEG’s H1 condo sales contributed over 61% to MEG’s H1 total revenues, with H1 sales growing 25% y/y. MEG’s leasing segment increased 19%, and contributed 27% to MEG’s H1 consolidated revenues. *MB: MEG said that this is the first time since the start of the pandemic that the company has seen double-digit increases across all of its business segments, and that this is a good sign for its quest to get back to pre-pandemic levels. They have improved, but they’re not there yet. MEG’s H1/19 net income was ₱8.9 billion, and its H1/22 net income of ₱6.7 billion is 25% lower. Shareholders are also a far cry from those H1/19 valuations, with the stock down 64% since MEG published its H1/19 results in August, before the pandemic.*
>    - **DMCI Holdings** [DMC 9.40 ▲1.62%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=3c5ff941f7aa5d9e3470cea4b051ca8f)] Q2 profit ▲73% y/y, ▲194% q/q, to ₱9.0 billion, with 1H net income ▲114% y/y to ₱20.2 billion, driven almost entirely by the outsized performance of Semirara Mining and Power [SCC 39.50 unch] amid this unprecedented rise in commodity and energy prices. The only DMC business unit that registered a negative quarter and negative half was Maynilad, which posted net losses of 9% y/y for Q2 and 1% y/y for H1, respectively. Maynilad suffered from lower water production, “flattish” billed volume, and higher operating expenses. *MB: This is really SCC’s world, and DMC shareholders are just living in it. Don’t get me wrong, DMC’s other units performed well (except for Maynilad), but if you replace SCC’s H1/22 with SCC’s H1/21, then DMC’s Q2 and H1 were basically flat. But that’s not how the world works, so for now, SCC and DMC are going to put up some video game-like numbers for a while.*
>    - **Q2 GDP** [[link](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/philippine-gdp-grows-less-than-expected-q2-2022-08-09/)] growth was 16% slower in Q2 than forecast, coming in at 7.2% (with the forecast at 8.6%). Q1 GDP growth was initially reported at 8.3%, but has been revised down to 8.2%. Despite the slowdown, Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said that our economy is “doing well” and could handle additional rate increases. *MB: REITs and other debt-heavy industries: cover your butts! Not only is the velocity of growth slowing, but those guiding the economy are still hot to raise rates, both in the short term, and in the medium/long-term. Inflation hasn’t peaked yet. I’m wondering when we’ll see the first uptick in non-performing loans. It’s been pretty smooth sailing for banks since the early days of the pandemic, but rising rates will hurt borrowers.*

>- **[NEWS]     Dito Telecommunity definitively a telco, according to Ookla...** Dito Telecommunity, a subsidiary of Dennis Uy’s DITO CME [DITO 4.19 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=5a04ba47d26d230f3470cea4b051ca8f)], was mentioned in a [report authored by Ookla](https://www.ookla.com/articles/philippines-mobile-performance-q1-2022) that tied overall cellular connectivity improvements made by Globe [GLO 2294.00 ▲1.96%] and SMART [TEL 1700.00 ▼0.35%] to DITO’s entrance into the market. According to Ookla, the Philippines as a whole still underperforms its peers in SE Asia by a pretty wide margin in terms of 4G download and upload speeds (15 Mbps and 5 Mbps, respectively), but since DITO’s launch in 2021, TEL and GLO have increased their average 4G speeds considerably; TEL’s average download speed increased 42% to 18.5 Mbps, and GLO’s increased 29% to 12.6 Mbps. DITO’s average download speed over the same period fell 26% to 15.8 Mbps, but still managed to beat GLO for second place. Ookla noted that DITO finished first in terms of “4G Availability” at 91%, which is the percentage of a provider’s users that spend the majority of their time connected to 4G networks, but also noted that this was “not surprising” considering that DITO was launched as a 4G-only operator (DITO’s 5G network is not yet widely available). DITO pushed out a [press release](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=5a04ba47d26d230f3470cea4b051ca8f) to say that it was “elated” and “very pleased” with the Ookla report, saying that the report “provides clear recognition by respected and independent organizations of the efforts being done by our subsidiary DITO Telecommunity Corp. in bringing world-class telecommunications services to Filipinos.”
>    - ***MB:*** *Look at that, DITO actually referred to Dito Telecommunity as its subsidiary! I feel like that’s a big step, considering how conspicuously-absent any mention of Dito Tel has been in any of DITO’s earnings reports. Joking aside, I think it’s actually refreshing to get some third-party analysis on the PH mobile industry. Sure, there are lots of moving parts that complicate any analysis, such as the constantly evolving footprint of DITO’s quickly-growing network, and how this growth in geographical region and subscriber count might impact average speeds over time. But it’s nice to see this data presented in a reasonably objective manner. Zooming out, though, what does this mean for Dito Tel as a business? The 5G network wasn’t big enough to measure. The 4G network is faster than GLO’s, but it’s actually slowing down over time (a trend that has been backed up by DITO subscribers that I know who have reported network slowdowns). It’s beyond question that Dito Tel’s addition to the market has been a huge benefit to Filipino consumers in terms of cheaper plans, faster speeds, wider reach, but how good has it been for DITO shareholders? DITO might have the country’s second-fastest 4G network, but can it make money? So far, that answer has been a resounding “no”. Can it improve its performance going forward? Well, that’s a much more difficult question to answer, since to this date, DITO has refused to provide a regular and objective count of basic telecommunications metrics like a segmented subscriber count, ARPU, or churn, that might allow shareholders and investors to track DITO’s execution and plot its potential improvement relative to GLO and TEL. Yes, according to Ookla, DITO is “present and accounted for”, but DITO shareholders aren’t in this to save GLO and TEL subscribers money on better service, and there’s only so long that a company can operate at a massive loss before things like having the country’s second-fastest 4G network, in a country with some of the slowest 4G speeds in the region, cease to be worth noting.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **BSP** [[link](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/14/philippine-central-bank-hikes-interest-rates.html)] surprised the market with a 75 basis point interest rate hike, after US inflation figures for July hit 9.1% and the US Fed began to openly debate a full 100 basis point raise later this month. The BSP said that there’s still room to raise rates more should further interest rate raises seem necessary. The raise was meant to address the white-hot inflation that we’ve been experiencing here, and to help stabilize the falling peso (especially relative to the USD). As Barkadans will remember, raising rates will only impact the “demand-pull” type of inflation that happens when demand for assets exceeds supply; it won’t do anything to address “cost-push” inflation, where higher prices for inputs (like labor, gas, iron, etc) get passed on to consumers. Will it help? Probably a bit. Will it have secondary effects? Oh yeah. And we aren’t even at peak inflation yet.
>    - **Aboitiz Family** [[link](https://business.inquirer.net/352820/sabin-aboitiz-named-as-private-sector-advisory-council-head)] on the rise within the Marcos regime? Marcos has appointed Sabin Aboitiz (head of the family group) as head of the Private Sector Advisory Council (PSAC), and in the announcement, Mr. Aboitiz said that the “close partnership between the public and private sectors will continue to deepen” thanks to the PSAC. Anindependent director of Aboitiz Power [AP 31.40 ▼0.32%], Raphael Lotilla, was targeted by Marcos to be Secretary of the Department of Energy, a seemingly obvious example of textbook [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture#:~:text=In%20politics%2C%20regulatory%20capture%20(also,a%20particular%20geographic%20area%2C%20industry%2C), only to have the Department of Justice throw a massive body-block by [hand-waving away](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/economy/838178/doj-popo-lotilla-nomination-to-doe-top-post-valid-lawful/story/) the law that was put in place to prevent just this kind of appointment. Feels like we might need to make some additions to the MB Crony Index!
>    - **Emperador** [EMI 18.10 ▲3.90%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=2bfc34283ae5eb3e3470cea4b051ca8f)] officially listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX); it started the day’s trading at SGD 0.435, and ended the day at SGD 0.450, with over 6 million shares traded. The SGX closing price, converted from SGD to PHP, is ₱18.08/share, which is ever-so-slightly lower than the ₱18.10 that EMI closed at yesterday on the PSE. I expect the PSE price to push/pull the SGX price (and not the other way around), but it will be interesting to see how these two listings react in real time, and if any patterns emerge, it might present opportunities for those with accounts that trade on the SGX (with fast execution) to scalp price action lags. Hard to say how financially viable those opportunities might be, but it’s something that interests me from an academic perspective!
>    - **Union Bank** [UBP 76.85 ▼0.07%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=2488de2c0625f0783470cea4b051ca8f)] received a BSP Certificate of Authority to operate its wholly-owned subsidiary, UnionBank Digital, as a digital bank. UBP said that this certificate was the final approval needed in what it described as a “3-stage digital bank license application process”. Looks like the Aboitiz Family is operating under clear skies right now.

>- **[FY21]     Cemex [CHP 1.04 ▼4.59%] FY21 profit ▼26%, Q4 profit down ▼176% y/y to net loss...** CHP released a FY21 and Q4/21 teaser, and [the results were not that great](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=c12033bf303c811b3470cea4b051ca8f). FY21 profit of ₱726 million, down 26% from FY20 profit of ₱985 million. Q4/21 net loss of ₱172 million, down y/y from Q4/20 profit of ₱227 million, and q/q from Q2/21 profit of ₱94 million. CHP reported that its net sales were up 6% for FY21, partly due to the easing of quarantine restrictions, but reported that sales were flat for Q4 y/y due to operations interruptions caused by Typhoon Odette. CHP said that its major equipment was not damaged in the storm, but sales efforts were impacted by “recovery efforts and infrastructure damage”. Despite the 26% drop in annual net income, CHP actually reported an 8% increase in its operating earnings and a 2/3rd decrease in its financing costs; those gains were basically wiped out by a ₱437 million in foreign exchange losses.
>    - ***MB:*** *CHP announced that it’s building a new “integrated cement production line” in Rizal that will cost at least $235 million USD, which Cemex estimates will finish construction in March 2024 and begin operations one month later in April 2024. This aligns with the recent disclosure by San Miguel [SMC 106.60 ▼3.00%] that it would look to double its cement production in its ₱10 billion facility in Davao. Yes, the headline net income numbers actually look terrible, but CHP’s actions reveal an optimism that is supported by CHP’s operating results. The Omicron wave looks short-lived given international examples and the macro-economic tailwinds for the cement industry are still in place, with government policy still supporting a country-wide infrastructure boom, and a generational demographic shift pushing a residential real estate development boom. CHP just has to keep the production lines up and operational.*

>- **[NEWS]     SPC Power Corp [SPC 14.72 ▼0.27%] suspended mid session after $52 million acquisition...** SPC disclosed that it, along with an affiliate company called  Intrepid Holdings, Inc (Intrepid), [signed a share purchase agreement](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=bc057884aa963c003470cea4b051ca8f) to acquire 51% of STEAG State Power Inc (SSPI) from a German power generation company called STEAG GmbH, for a total purchase price of $52 million USD (₱2.67 billion). Under the terms of the agreement, SPC will acquire 40.5% of SSPI, while Intrepid will acquire 10.5%. The acquired company, SSPI, owns a 210 megawatt (MW) [coal-fired power plant in Misamis Oriental](https://www.bworldonline.com/spc-affiliate-buy-steags-51-stake-in-power-firm/). SPC said that the acquisition will “support growth” and help satisfy the country’s need for “reliable, affordable and sustainable power supply.” The PSE suspended SPC’s stock at 11:11am due to the applicability of the “Substantial Acquisition Rule”; to lift the suspension, SPC will need to provide comprehensive disclosure on the transaction itself and the impact of the transaction on SPC’s business going forward. According to SSPI’s website, Aboitiz Power [AP 34.05 ▼3.40%] holds a [34% stake in SSPI](https://www.steagstatepower.com/about#shareholders).
>    - ***MB:*** *Coal-fired power plants are some of the cheapest “baseload” power plants to build and operate, but the future of coal-fired power plants in the Philippines was dramatically altered by the Department of Energy’s surprise policy prohibiting “greenfield” license approvals for new coal-fired power plant construction, and the eventual phaseout of existing plants as they near end-of-life. This sale transfers all of STEAG GmbH’s stake in SSPI, which was STEAG GmbH’s only investment in the Philippines. While the power plant that SPC purchased is still generating electricity in one of the most harmful and short-sighted ways possible, the grid itself doesn’t actually care about how the electricity was made. Coal-fired power plants provide (theoretically) reliable baseload power, day and night, rain or shine. The price of coal has gone up considerably, and our coal-fired power plants have been having a strangely hard time staying operational as of late, but the ability of these power plants to generate power during the night or when it is overcast (when solar isn’t generating) will be useful to our grid for years/decades to come.*

>- **[Q&A]     What does it mean for CREIT if most PSE EASy subscribers received full allocations?...** I’ve received many reports from Barkadans and seen many messages in all the usual forums indicating that many (most/all?) investors that applied for subscriptions to the Citicore Energy REIT [CREIT 2.55 pre-IPO] IPO received full allocations, even though we can safely assume that the institutional bucket/tranche was oversubscribed, as were many of the broker buckets/tranches. The question, about what it means for the CREIT IPO to be oversubscribed with respect to the institutional and broker tranches, but not the PSE EASy tranche, is hard to answer with any certainty. In practical terms, it might just mean that this IPO attracted a higher number of “big-account” investors (“whales”, in crypto-speak) that soaked up the institutional and broker tranches relatively quickly with a small number of huge orders, but that the retail demand wasn’t able to exhaust the PSE EASy tranche so easily due to the subscription limit. While take-up of the PSE EASy tranche is considered by some to be a proxy for retail’s interest in an IPO, selling out of shares in the PSE EASy tranche is actually something that hasn’t happened that often. The last time it happened, with AllDay Marts [ALLDY 0.57 unch], the PSE was caught trying to figure out what to do in real-time as thousands of investors required substantial refunds for fractional PSE EASy allocations. ALLDY was oversubscribed across all tranches, but if you remember, ALLDY hit the ceiling on its first day (+50%), then started a grueling 3-month nose-dive that erased all those gains within 40 days and that continues to this day, with the stock currently sitting 5% below its IPO offer price. The next IPO, Medilines Distributors [MEDIC 1.04 ▼3.70%], apparently oversubscribed on its institutional tranche, but nothing else. We all know the tragic hilarity that ensued. Solar Philippines NEC [SPNEC 2.08 ▲2.97%] was after MEDIC, and became oversubscribed institutionally and at the broker level, but not at the PSE EASy level. SPNEC has doubled in price since its debut nearly two months ago.
>    - ***MB:*** *Selling out the PSE EASy tranche is a rare occurrence, and when it does happen (like with ALLDY), it’s not all that great for IPO investors beyond the first few days of elevated pricing. CREIT’s oversubscription profile (institutional and broker tranches oversubscribed, PSE EASy apparently not oversubscribed) matches most closely with SPNEC’s case, but as we’ve covered in previous MBs, it’s dangerous to draw too many conclusions on CREIT based on SPNEC’s case because of the structural differences between the offerings (REIT vs non-operational company) and their vastly different approaches to solar power development (land lease vs joint venture development). While both CREIT and SPNEC may go down as having sold out their institutional and broker tranches, their post-IPO performances may vary considerably in a way that doesn’t follow from their seeming pre-IPO similarities. So, what does it mean? Probably that there’s demand for that relatively high and stable dividend among those with deep pockets and a desire to find stores of value that can assist against inflation, but that retail’s demand for that kind of thing might be somewhat less rabid.*

Context: 
So due to my grandfather (he is living in the States) getting older, he wanted to organize his estate while he is still alive. My mom is his only child, so she is the only heir to his properties here in the Philippines. The land in question is around 4.93 hectares (for scale its a little bit smaller than the size of DLSU- Manila) and is along the provincial road. And the good part of the property is that it is 5-10 mins away from the newly constructed Bicol International Airport. 

The estimated value of the property excluding the forestry products in the property is between 75-80 million. All of the paperwork, the Spanish, American, Philippine land titles are complete and updated. The taxes and dues are also up-to-date. Basically we can already sell the land tomorrow if there is a buyer. 

Dilemma:
As the title of the post suggests, when is the right time to sell this track of land? Or should my family even sell it? My family doesn’t really need the money at the moment, we are comfortable with or without it but a couple of million in the bank wouldn’t hurt. I know from reading the posts in this sub is that land is the best form of investment because its value always rises overtime.  

My parents want to sell it but they aren’t necessarily in a hurry to dispose of it immediately. My argument as to why we shouldn’t sell is because the cash that we could get would be eaten away by the increasing inflation rate of the country. And after doing my research I estimate that the value of the land could increase to +120 million plus in the next 8-10 years due to its vicinity to the airport. Or if the area eventually booms I thought that my family could rent the land to malls or restaurants so that we can have a continuous source of income.  As of the moment we have a caretaker for the land, his family has been taking care of it for 3 generations and he is growing and selling copra to pay for his family’s living expenses and to pay for the taxes of the property.

And on a personal note, I really don’t want to sell the land due to it being with my family since the Spanish period and has been for 6 generations. I just wanted to share this to other people because my parents are getting old and if we don't sell it, as the panganay of the family, I will eventually handle this property so I wanted to have a plan for it.

Your thoughts and comments are highly appreciated because I have no clue what to do with the property.",1645019904.0

Personally I would not sell that - at least not yet and definitely not at the price you mentioned. I would hold over that for a few more years, get the surrounding area gentrified and probably you can get twice the coin that you are expecting now in 5 yrs time.

Take it from me, just like you we have been holding a similar sized plot of land as yours that is in our small family for almost a century. Previously it was just in the middle of nowhere now it is in front of a big international facility as well.

I have families in Bicolandia too - yours is an excellent area and I definitely think it will boom soon. Just like anything else (extra longer time for Bicol sadly), it takes time.

>- **[NEWS]     Is Au-Ghost real? My data-driven analysis concludes: “Maybe”...** First, a quick background on the Ghost Month phenomenon before I start throwing ugly charts at you. PSE traders and analysts have long held that August is a terrible month on the market, though nobody is really able to point to why this might be the case. Sure, functionally, there is usually less buying and selling (liquidity), and a drop in liquidity is usually not a great sign in combination with the market’s perceived lack of conviction. But instead of trying to figure out which came first, the low liquidity or the weak conviction, I wanted to go back into the PSE’s history to figure out if August is actually the worst-performing month, or if it just has a really bad reputation. Spoiler alert: August sucks, but like most things in life, COVID has changed things a bit. 
>    - **➤ The data:** My first step was to take the starting PSE value and ending PSE value for each month, starting with January 2012, and ending in July 2022. Then, I divided the difference between the two values by the month’s starting value to get the percentage change for the month. That’s it. Pretty straight forward.  
>    - **➤ The complication:** Right away, the “stain” of COVID was visible. The single worst month in recent PSE history was March 2020, when the Duterte lockdowns were first announced, leading to a devastating 22% monthly drop. Before that, March had only ever been in the negatives once since 2012, back in 2018, when the PSE fell 6%. The next-worst monthly performance was a 9% loss, which was a tie between July of last year, and June of this year. That COVID Crash in March really skews the data. So, with that in mind, we’re going to look at this using a “COVID-in” and “COVID-out” approach, where for “COVID-in” we just take every month as it happened from January 2012 up till now, including COVID, and for “COVID-out” we remove everything COVID by only counting data from January 2012 up until the start of 2020.  
>    - **➤ COVID-in:** August sucks, with an average 10-year loss of 0.7%, but March manages to suck even more, with an average loss of 1.1%. March is actually the worst-performing month, despite being negative only 4 times out of the last 10 years, as compared to August’s dismal 7 times out of the last 10 years. It was kind of surprising to me to see that October is actually, by far, the best-performing month, with a 10-year average gain of 2%. It was even weirder to see such performance sandwiched between November and September, the 3rd and 4th worst performing months, respectively. But the key thing here is what COVID did to March: before COVID, March was negative just once. Since COVID in 2020, March has been negative every year: -22% in 2020, -5% in 2021, and -1% in 2022. Ok, so if we take the COVID Years out, does August take its rightful place as the statistically-worst month of the year on the PSE? 
>    - **➤ COVID-out:** Yes, without COVID, August sucks the most. Removing all of 2020 through 2022, August stands alone as the clear “worst” month, with the worst average return of -1.9%, and most number of times negative with 6. Free from the ravages of COVID, March bounces all the way up to the second-best performing month, with an average return of 2%, and only one instance of negative returns. Messing with the timeline doesn’t work so well for October, though, which falls from “best returning month” to just middle-of-the-pack. The best month, in the pre-COVID data, is January with an average return of 3.8%, followed by March (2.0%) and July (1.9%). July looks positively safe, with zero negative months in its 10-year dataset.  
>    - **➤ Is Au-GHOST real?** Yes, but as with most things in life, there’s some nuance there that complicates things. Clearly, whether COVID-in or COVID-out, August just kind of sucks. It’s near the bottom of the table for monthly returns in either dataset, and finishes at the top of the table in both for the number of times it gave a negative monthly return. That said, the historical pattern of monthly returns has clearly shifted thanks to COVID and the waves of loss and rebound that we’ve seen roll through our market multiple times since the first days of the pandemic. Before COVID, there was probably a pretty good argument to be made that November was just as bad as August, and that its stealth poor performance was actually somehow worse for being less obvious. Since COVID, it’s clear that March (so far) has been the new August.
>    - ***MB:*** *While March has shown some real promise to challenge August for the title of “Worst PSE Month of the Year”, it remains to be seen if the perception of August as a poor performer will continue to drive that poor performance, or if the disruption of COVID will somehow erase that feeling over time. Perhaps August’s “brand” is just too powerful. It has a catchy, punny name (Au-Ghost) that ties in with a rich context of lore. Comparatively, March and November are just anonymous poor performers with none of that world-class branding. All that aside it’s hard to ignore that there is simply a lack of focus on the market in August. As some have pointed out, it’s maybe not so much of a coincidence that interest in our market drops as North American fund managers step away from their desks to go on summer vacation. Maybe, in that way, August is actually the best month. Not from a liquidity, performance, or interest perspective, but from a mental health one where traders are given the excuse to close those 40 open tabs of charts and news and take a short break.*

PAL said that it had ₱4.2 billion of net income in H1, on ₱58.1 billion in revenues. It noted a 258% growth in passenger revenues y/y, and a 31% growth in cargo revenues. PAL basically has one year left on the relief of its renegotiated plane leases, which allowed PAL to only pay according to its fleet usage. In July of next year, that flips back to a straight lease, where PAL pays for its contractual lease obligations on all of its planes, whether it’s using them or not. These next 12 months are crucial to PAL in terms of being able to reinvent itself from being a complete money-loser, to something that can make a reliable profit in the changed travel landscape. PAL’s nostalgic messaging about rebuilding its network “for Filipinos” doesn’t make me very hopeful that it has learned lasting lessons.

The announcement was made in coordination with the US Secretary of State, as part of a push to mitigate climate change impacts on vulnerable countries like ours. Whether this is vaporware or something that will directly benefit AP shareholders in the medium- or long-term is not even close to being known yet. Political announcements are always big on flash, features, and benefits, but there’s a lot of work that needs to happen between now and when AP can actually put shovels into the ground.

The macro issues that ALI is talking about here are inflation and supply-chain issues. Like other retail leasing companies, ALI noted a huge uptick in mall revenue. Still, shareholders are probably still a little dumbstruck by ALI’s sharp price decline of over 33% since March. The current price is actually 1.5% lower than its COVID Crash closing price of ₱26.30/share.

No news is good news, as the idiom goes. Except if you write a daily financial newsletter. Hahahuhu. Instead of trying to make something interesting out of nothing, and instead of talking about DITO for the third straight day, I'm just going to go on a tangent and do a little high-level meta analysis. Check it out below.

Starting with IPOs, I take a closer look at the overall performance of the group (hint: it sucks). I talk a little bit about what might be causing that, about what might not be causing it, and what role the exchange has in protecting us from these bad outcomes (hint: none). 

Then, moving on to trading superstitions, I take a closer look at the historical performance of the market during ""Ghost Month"", and attempt to answer the question: has Ghost Month come early? Are we suffering from Pre Ghost Month Syndrome?

Fingers crossed we get some real news to talk about soon. Thanks to **Jewel** for the research! I'm very lucky to have Jewel back on the team. 

Thanks also to **Jing** for the meme appreesh, to /u/saidinbu, /u/MemoryEXE, /u/pink_fedora2000, /u/dnkstrm, **kalelManila.eth**, **CamoteTrader**, **Sandeep iG Chandiramani**, and /u/cmdrsiohe for joining the discussion on DITO's performance, DITO's metrics, and the outlook for the company.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[META]     IPOs have lost the public over ₱5 billion over the past year...** The PSE has played host to 14 IPOs over the trailing 12 months (TTM), starting with Filinvest REIT [FILRT 6.78 ▲0.44%] in August of 2021, and ending (so far) with Balai Ni Fruitas [BALAI 0.67 ▲3.08%] a little over two weeks ago. While each stock’s price changes every day, the overall trend has been decidedly negative. One one stock is in positive territory (Solar Philippines NEC [SPNEC 1.56 ▼1.89%]). The 14 IPOs took over ₱79 billion from public investors, and those shares are now worth just ₱73 billion. That’s an aggregate loss of nearly ₱6 billion (▼7.5%). Driving that loss are the four IPOs that have lost more than 30% of their value: Medilines Distributors [MEDIC 0.63 ▲1.61%], AllDay Marts [ALLDY 0.28 unch], Haus Talk [HTI 0.87 ▼3.33%], and Bank of Commerce [BNCOM 8.30 ▼1.89%]. But it’s not like these companies are bad businesses; there are decent arguments that can be made on behalf of each one. And it’s not like these were all bricks from the start; I mean, MEDIC was, but HTI, ALLDY, and BNCOM all had positive first days. ALLDY even hit the ceiling on its first day. The REITs all had pretty sustained success through the latter part of 2021 and the early part of 2022, before interest rate hikes started to tarnish their (comparative) luster. But what accounts for such a sad list of poor performances? If we consider each stock to be a “family”, then the Leo Tolstoy quote comes to mind: “All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”.
>    - ***MB:*** *The market is down and uncertain. Inflation is high and rising. Interest rates are rising. The pandemic still hampers a complete return to normal. All of these factors, in one way or another, have revalued all of the companies on the PSE, and IPOs are no different. Some IPOs appear to have been overvalued from the very start, while others were only revealed to be overvalued in the weeks and months that followed their IPO. Yet others seemed to be properly valued (or even undervalued) when they were introduced, within the context of the time of their introduction, only to have later events hack and slash at their valuations. These results should inform future IPO investors about the great uncertainty that comes with IPO investing; these are not automatic money-makers. They’re not all slam dunks. Even with a stabilization fund, there’s a lot of risk to investing in these offerings. That’s not to say that IPOs are bad, but it is to say that you need to use your discretion. IPOs sell at the highest price the market will pay for the offer stock. It’s not the PSE’s job to make sure that the wider investing community agrees with this initial valuation. It’s not the PSE’s job to carefully curate IPOs to make sure that investors avoid loss. It’s the PSE’s job to help companies access the public capital markets to raise money. As investors, it’s our job to figure out what deserves our money and what doesn’t. That responsibility cannot be delegated.*

>- **[META]     Are we suffering from a case of PGMS (Pre-Ghost Month Syndrome)?...** “Ghost Month” comes from the Chinese observation of the [Ghost Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Festival) in August, when the gates of hell are believed to be opened, and the ghosts roam free looking for food and fun. While the actual start of the Ghost Festival depends on the Lunar Calendar, and changes slightly from year to year, it’s taken on something of a colloquial meaning for the Philippine Stock Market to apply to the entire month of August. I mean, “Au-ghost”, amirite? It’s just science. Anyway, the thought is that there is a downturn in investment activity during this festival because the ghosts are believed to interfere and bring bad luck for investment decisions made during this time. That said, it’s not like PSE volume drops to zero, so some people have to be buying and selling shares! How have investors fared during the past 10 Ghost Months? Taken as a whole, measuring the value of the PSE from August 1 through August 31, for all years back to 2012, investors are down 2.6%. That’s not great, but the negative performance isn’t uniform. Half of the past 10 years have seen negative performance in August; -2.1% in 2012, -8.6% in 2013, -6.6% in 2015. -2.9% in 2016, and -1.0% in 2019. We just had the most profitable August in recent memory, +8.3% in 2021 (part of the continuing COVID recovery), but that kind of recovery momentum is definitely not the contextual moment that we find ourselves in right now. Sharp drops are more common than sharp pops.
>    - ***MB:*** *The Ghost Festival doesn’t even start until August 12 this year! Why does the market feel so thin already? For even the most casual of observers, July has been... uneventful. The MB Market Calendar is already empty for the month, and it has been for quite some time. No IPOs. No big events. A few low-profile earnings reports, but the vast majority aren’t expected to hit the PSE’s disclosure server until sometime in early August. Has Ghost Month come early? From a sentiment perspective, I don’t know many confident investors right now. We’re down 2% over the past month of trading. Lots of short-term traders are in cash, waiting for more market conviction. Lots of longer-term traders have taken a more defensive stance while the red slowly swallows their positions. To me, it feels like the ghosts are early this year. Feels like we’ve got some of that PGMS. Only question is whether it’s going to get worse as we stumble into the real Ghost Month? Not much in the calendar that we could use to jump-start the market. Solar Philippines NEC [SPNEC 1.56 ▼1.89%] SRO will go on sale in late August and list in mid-September, so maybe that will provide some intrigue that we can get excited about? Grasping at straws here.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **The PSE** [PSE 175.00 ▲0.57%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=611ec05a23e5ef9c3470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed that it still has over ₱1.6 billion left from the ₱2.8 billion it raised four years ago. That’s quite a chunk of cash! I wonder if any of that money could be used to build a more robust payment infrastructure for PSE EASy? We’re over halfway through a year that the PSE was hoping would be thick with equity raise events, and we are still stuck wondering with each IPO whether our broker will sign up for electronic payments or not. Don’t get me started about refunds. Spend that money, PSE! Four years and you haven’t even spent half of it!
>    - **MEDCO Holdings** [MED 0.28 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=b8f46aa546d4a72e3470cea4b051ca8f)] put out the first quarterly earnings report of the “standard schedule” (quarters ending March/June/September/December) Q2 season. Not much to say about this report; MED’s Q2 income was up 29%, but it still posted a ₱1.4 million net loss. Meh.
>    - **Converge** [CNVRG 20.25 unch] [[link](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/07/18/converge-network-speed-gets-nod-of-ookla-consumers/)] rated “Top-Rated Fixed Network in the Philippines” for H1/22 by Ookla, the Internet speedtest company. The award was based on a consumer satisfaction poll. The stock is down 35% in just 3 months, so I bet a “shareholder satisfaction survey” would have a slightly different outcome.

Part of my work has me comparing text/calls/data rates of telcos & fiber ISPs.

What all telcos & ISPs want subs to do is

- subscribe
- forget to renew
- keep paying on time
- say ""yes"" when they call when they ask if you want to upgrade
- not notice the competition is around

What all telcos & ISPs want subs to not do is

- keep a reminder for the 23rd or 35th month of the contract to request for (1) downgrade, (2) Mbps alignment or (3) termination of service to switch provider
- negotiate for better terms
- not pay on time

ARPUs are a great way to figure where over 80% of all subs are able to spend on. This also corresponds to the income bracket of these household and the number of persons each household has.

Consumer postpaid phone plans are approx 2x more expensive than corporate plans. My guess is that consumers tend to default more so they need to factor that into costing.

Similar to why 5-6 utang loan sharks impose a 20% per month interest rate vs BSP-licensed lenders having a more humane interest rates.",1658188846.0

>- **[NEWS]     Premiere Horizon Alliance sued by its own director for non-payment of debt...** Premiere Horizon Alliance [PHA 0.32 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=a336df67cec324833470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed yesterday that it had been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Brandon Benito P. Leong (BBPL), a director and shareholder of PHA, alleging that Marvin C. Dela Cruz (MCDC) and his company, SquidPay Technology Inc. (SquidPay), have failed to make payments on a ₱100-million loan that came due in July. The loan had a convertibility clause which allowed BBPL to elect to take payment in PHA shares, which he did. BBPL alleges that his conversion notice was not heeded, nor were payments made by MCDC or SquidPay to pay off the debt at maturity. A regional trial court granted BBPL’s request for a Writ of Preliminary Attachment “against the properties of [SquidPay] and Marvin C. Dela Cruz”. PHA notes that it is listed as a defendant, but that it has not received “any summons or other documents” relating to the case. PHA also said that the order would have “no impact on the operations and financial condition of PHA”, as it is “merely” implementing an order to freeze MCDC’s PHA shares. MCDC purchased 55% of PHA’s shares for ₱925 million back in October of 2020, with the first ₱300 million in cash and the rest in a combination of cash and (maybe) stock in SquidPay.
>    - ***MB:*** *SquidNoPay, amirite!? What a mess. It’s not clear if this ₱100 million convertible loan was ever disclosed by BBPL or Mr. Dela Cruz, but the timing of the loan is quite interesting. The loan agreement was signed on December 14, 2020, when BBPL gave Mr. Dela Cruz ₱100 million. Then, four days later, Mr. Dela Cruz used the funding to make the second tranche payment of ₱113 million on the ₱300 million cash down-payment he owed for his PHA shares under the October 2020 agreement. Because the deal is a private one between BBPL and Mr. Dela Cruz, the agreement (to the best of my knowledge) wasn’t disclosed and the terms (like the conversion strike price) are not publicly available. If we assumed Mr. Dela Cruz’s PHA acquisition price of ₱0.33/share to be the strike price, then BBPL’s conversion would entitle him to roughly 303 million of Mr. Dela Cruz’s 2.8 billion PHA shares, or approximately 5.3% of PHA’s outstanding shares, and reduce Mr. Dela Cruz’s ownership stake to less than 50%. Presumably the strike price is higher, because it would have been a terrible strategic move for Mr. Dela Cruz to sign a loan deal that could result in the loss of majority ownership of PHA, in which case, there may be some impact to PHA that goes beyond simply “implementing a court order”. But until we learn more, we won’t know how many stocks BBPL is entitled to from MCDC’s stash.*

>- **[NEWS]     North Star Meat Merchants looking for a strategic investor to take 10-20%...** Anthony Ng, the owner and CEO of North Star Meat Merchants [NSTAR 10.00 pre-IPO] [[link](https://manilastandard.net/business/corporate/314266125/north-star-in-talks-with-strategic-investors-after-shelving-ipo-plan.html)], is reported by Jenniffer Austria the Manila Standard to have said he’s taking calls from domestic and foreign strategic investors, and is interested in selling a 10 to 20% stake in NSTAR to an investor group that can provide funding for expansion and act as a “platform” for future growth. Mr. Ng said that his decision to defer the 2022 IPO of NSTAR was “providential” considering the poor performance of the market, but that he “remains interested in pushing through with [NSTAR’s] IPO” sometime in 2023, or, as Ms. Austria puts it, “when market conditions improve”. Mr. Ng said that he would continue to expand NSTAR ahead of any 2023 IPO in order to increase its valuation.
>    - ***MB:*** *In the world of equity investing, a “strategic” investor is usually a bigger company in the same industry or value-chain, where the strategic investor takes a minority stake in exchange for cash and some additional “value-add” that is (most times) mutually-beneficial to some degree. While a “financial” investor might only look at the opportunity to flip the stake or generate cash, a strategic investor can stay with a company for a longer time, often due to whatever integrations are contemplated by the parties during the initial negotiations. In NSTAR’s case, a strategic investor might come in the form of a cold storage logistics company that is looking to get some exposure up the value chain to NSTAR’s retail-facing business, while at the same time, getting commitments from NSTAR for use of the cold storage’s facilities in certain locations. Or maybe from a mid-market grocery chain that is looking to level-up its meat section with NSTAR’s in-house products or through some other joint venture. The point is that NSTAR would get an injection of cash, which it could use to expand its facilities and purchase inventory at discounts, then also take the opportunity to leverage whatever network benefits the strategic investor has to improve some other aspect of NSTAR’s financial situation. Then, at some point when NSTAR could demonstrate these benefits through its financial statements, walk those statements to the market and try to raise a bigger chunk of money through an IPO to fund further expansion.*

>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *It’s basically Ramon Ang telling Ramon Ang that he’s selling his shares to Ramon Ang. That he’d be able to come to an agreement with himself was never going to be an issue. What could still be an issue, though, is the Philippine Competition Commission’s (PCC) review of the potential merger. Once the PCC is notified, there’s an initial review of the application that takes about 2 weeks, then if everything is in order, the PCC will conduct a 30-day Phase 1 review. If the merger poses no material harm to competition, then the PCC will approve, otherwise, if further investigation is required, the PCC will conduct a 60-day Phase 2 review to take a closer look at any issues raised in its “Statement of Concerns”. Basically, we need to wait until mid-November to hear the first bit of real news from the PCC.*
>    - **San Miguel** [SMC 101.00 ▲2.02%] [[link](https://mb.com.ph/2022/10/05/smc-to-continue-supplying-power-to-meralco/)] said that it will continue to supply power to Meralco [MER 290.20 ▼2.75%] under its power supply agreements, but only for the duration of the 60--day period that is required following the ERC’s rejection of the joint request by SMC and MER for a temporary power rate increase. SMC has said that it will break the agreements with MER and sell the power at spot prices, and “explore other legal remedies” that will allow it to reduce its losses while satisfying its “obligations to stakeholders.” 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *This issue comes down to fixed-rate power supply agreements that SMC and MER signed back in 2019, in The Before Times. The fixed-rates in the agreement somehow didn’t include any mechanisms for adjusting to massive changes in the price of electricity, or the commodities used to create it, and because of that, SMC has been eating large opportunity-cost losses. SMC’s threat to unilaterally break the supply agreements would have caused MER to acquire the lost supply at spot rates, which probably would have been at a higher cost for consumers. Now that the ERC has rejected that application, SMC is just waiting the required cool-down time before it can terminate the agreements and sell into the spot market. Maybe I’m off on this, but it feels like SMC was just hoping to keep its wildly defective supply contracts in-place through a negotiated (and predictable) garnishment of consumers through MER’s billing, instead of a variable/market rate that it would make selling into the spot market. Either way, rates for that power (in particular) probably need to go up. Either way, rates need to go up. Granted, I know nothing about the specifics of the contract or the framework that created the contract between SMC and MER, but it seems cleaner to put the ball in SMC’s court, who took the price risk in the contract, on whether it would like to continue selling cheap power to MER or cancel the agreement. That’s what the ERC did. I can’t see how charging a “temporary” increased rate through MER would cure the disastrous drafting of the original contract; wouldn’t we all (consumers, ERC, SMC, MER) be back in the same situation next year when such a temporary rate increase inevitably expires into the same background conditions that caused it to be created in the first place?*
>    - **Metrobank** [MBT 51.00 ▲0.10%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=77f3ef5a45646d533470cea4b051ca8f)] now selling at least ₱10 billion in 5% fixed-rate bonds. The minimum investment amount is ₱500,000. The offer will run from now until October 19, with listing on the Philippine Dealing Exchange on October 28. The issuance is part of an existing ₱200 billion bond and commercial paper program approved by the board in December 2021. Proceeds will be used for working capital. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *Nothing about the OPEC news, or our own inflation news, says that rates will be cooling down soon. Why not sell some bonds now, knowing that rates will probably go up for some time yet? At the very least, the OPEC thing will probably make it difficult to lower rates any time soon.*

- **DD**: 11:15 AM
- **CEB**: 1:30 PM
- **PX**: 2:15 PM
- **SCC**: 3:10 PM

These are not do-nothing shell companies, and there is a LOT going on under the surface of each of these companies that is worth talking about.

>- **[Q2]     JG Summit Q2 profit ~~down 95%~~ up 335% y/y, ~~but~~ and up 190% q/q...** JG Summit [JGS 55.05 ▲1.38%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=46f2b5b05c3b06f73470cea4b051ca8f)], the Gokongwei Family’s diversified conglomerate, posted a Q2 net income of ~~₱44 million down 95%~~ ₱2.5 billion, up 335% y/y from Q2/21’s ~~₱81~~ ₱815 million in profit, ~~but~~ and up ~~102%~~ 190% q/q from Q1/22’s net loss of ₱2.79 billion. Here are the net incomes attributable to each of JGS’s main business units from best to worst: Robinsons Land [RLC 19.06 ▲1.38%] (₱3.3 billion; +154% q/q), Universal Robina [URC 124.90 ▼0.79%] (₱2.7 billion; -23% q/q), Cebu Pacific [CEB 45.35 ▼0.66%] (-₱1.9 billion; +75% q/q), and JG Summit Olefins [JGSO] (-₱3.2 billion; -52% q/q). While CEB continues to (predictably) drag on JGS’s profitability, the reopening of the economy has bumped passenger volumes and allowed it to slash the loss to the point where it wasn’t even the largest money-loser in the stable. That crown now belongs to JGSO, which actually saw losses accelerate in Q2 due to the near-doubling of input costs, and the shutdown of its petrochemicals plant in late May due to “high customer inventories going into 2Q22”, “weak overall demand”, and “bearish margins“. JGS doesn’t plan to reopen the facility until sometime in September.
>    - ***MB:*** *~~Yikes.~~ That’s a real “dog’s breakfast” of a quarter for one of the country’s leading conglomerates. It’s easy to look past the JGSO result because that’s the only major private subsidiary that contributes materially to JGS’s earnings (all the rest are public companies), but it’s lost ₱5.3 billion so far this year, and the plant is going to be closed for the majority of Q3, so the losses aren’t going to stop any time soon. Even if the plant were to re-open for Q4, their own outlook for this business is bleak; low demand, high competition, expensive inputs with volatile pricing. RLC and URC are doing fine, but the conglomerate’s overall exposure to first-order inflation risk through JGSO, and second-order inflation risk through CEB and RLC, make the next few quarters crucial to a broader understanding of the medium-term JGS narrative. When will inflation peak? What will the peak look like? What policy moves will we have made to address that peak? How will those moves change demand for housing and travel? What will happen to commodity prices that will rise and fall independently of those moves?* EDIT: Corrections applied. My script read the report wrong, and I was in a rush and I didn't catch it at all! My apologies. I think that my analysis on JGS's exposure to inflation still stands, though.

>- **[Q2]     VistaREIT declares first div, still waiting on clarification...** VistaREIT [VREIT 1.75 ▲0.57%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=f0f6aa21b3492ae93470cea4b051ca8f)] declared a Q2 dividend of ₱0.021/share, payable September 20 to shareholders of record on August 30. This is the retail REIT’s first dividend, though the REIT Plan provided by the Villar Family said that investors should expect to see a full-quarter dividend that is around ₱0.036/share.
>    - ***MB:*** *We’ll have to wait for VREIT to publish its Q2 earnings report to understand this div. Considering VREIT only conducted its IPO in the middle of June, just two weeks before the end of Q2, we need to know the amount of Q2 this distributed income represents to figure out the annualized yield of this dividend. For example, if the dividend only represented the final two weeks of the quarter, we’d “quarterize” the amount of the dividend by dividing it by two (to find the weekly dividend rate), then multiplying that figure by 13 (the number of weeks in a quarter). Doing that gives us a quarterized div of ₱0.1365/share, which would provide an annualized estimated yield of 7.80%, which is about 5% lower than the projections provided in the plan. There’s nothing stopping the family from declaring a dividend for income earned prior to the IPO, since the IPO itself was just the first time that the company’s stocks were widely traded on a public market, not the first day of the company’s operation. Barkadans might remember how Citicore Energy REIT [CREIT 2.49 ▲1.63%] declared a special dividend just after its IPO in February, from income generated in the previous year. So, this div could be anything; let’s wait for clarification.*

>- **[Q2]     DDMP REIT declares a slightly smaller Q2 div...** DDMP REIT [DDMPR 1.54 ▲1.99%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=32501aa2da57878d3470cea4b051ca8f)] declared a Q2 dividend of ₱0.027299/share, payable September 26 to shareholders of record on August 31. The Q2 div is 2% smaller than its Q1 div, and 2% smaller than its Q2/21 div from the same period last year. Based on DDMPR’s share price of ₱1.54/share, the slight change in the div didn’t have any material impact on the annualized estimated yield, which held firm at 7.24%. The dividend bumped DDMPR’s total return, a combination of its stock price movement plus all dividends relative to its IPO price, to -23.6%, up from -24.8%.
>    - ***MB:*** *It feels like the market wasn’t sold on the stability of this REIT’s portfolio, but despite everything that has happened in the commercial leasing market, DDMPR has delivered roughly the same quarterly dividend for the past year. There were whispers that the POGO exodus had hurt DDMPR disproportionately, or that the BPO work-from-home problems were causing particular problems for the company, and it felt like investors might be waiting for another data point (this dividend) to gain some confidence in the company’s ability to continue delivering that same dividend quarter after quarter. Well, here it is. Yes, the div is slightly lower when other commercial REITs have been able to marginally grow (except for Filinvest REIT [FILRT 6.50 unch], which completely face-planted in a way that I don’t think the market has truly digested yet), but, like I just mentioned, this is no FILRT. At the same time, I know I speak for many DDMPR investors when I say that I want to see more from this REIT in terms of growth. Not so much organic growth (increasing rents, decreasing expenses), but regular inorganic growth in the form of acquisitions. DDMPR’s parent, DoubleDragon [DD 7.51 ▼1.05%], has been around town checking out some prospects, and while I don’t think it’s important to close a deal just for the sake of pushing assets down into the REIT, I would like to see something happen just as a “proof of concept” for the REIT’s growth potential.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **Ayala Corp** [AC 750.00 ▲2.32%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=4db655974dcd04583470cea4b051ca8f)] President and CEO, Fernando “FZA” Zobel de Ayala, has taken temporary medical leave. While he will still retain his position on AC’s board of directors, FZA stepped down from his position as President and CEO, and also resigned from his membership on two of AC’s key board committees (executive and finance). In an unplanned meeting, the board elected Cezar Consing as “Acting President and CEO and member of [AC’s] Executive Committee.” MB: I don’t like to speculate on the health and welfare of anyone, though there are some concerning messages that we could infer from some of the circumstances of this announcement. The board seems to have been forced to act quickly, and FZA’s brother, Jaime, was the one who needed to speak to the public on FZA’s behalf through Facebook to say that FZA was in “high spirits”. FZA also resigned from his board committee posts, which to me suggests a longer leave than most might reasonably assume when first reading the “temporary” characterization. Best wishes to FZA.
>    - **Fruitas** [FRUIT 1.05 ▲1.94%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=8dd54da549f4e3e43470cea4b051ca8f)] Q2 profit of ₱22.9 million (▲232% y/y, ▲259% q/q), with H1 profit of ₱29.3 million (▲440% y/y), driven by a 50% increase in revenues and a simultaneous (but slight) growth in gross margin. FRUIT credits its results to “business expansion” and a “leaner cost structure”. On the balance sheet, FRUIT recorded a massive increase in cash in Q2, from ₱318 million at the start of Q1 to ₱609 million at the end of Q2, due mainly to the equity raised through the listing of Balai Ni Fruitas [BALAI 0.88 ▲3.53%] on the last day of the quarter. This was FRUIT’s best quarterly performance since its IPO in 2019. MB: It’s interesting to see FRUIT expand its margins at a time when its food input costs should have increased dramatically over the first half of 2021. I’ve often praised FRUIT’s execs for their quick forward thinking in response to the onset of the pandemic, and it would be great to see their moves begin to bear fruit (sorry). We’ve seen several confirmation points to this broader economic/retail recovery with Jollibee [JFC 233.20 ▲0.52%], 7-Eleven [SEVN 69.00 ▲3.76%], and Shakey’s [PIZZA 7.80 ▼1.89%] all showing similar turnarounds.
>    - **Solar Philippines** [SPNEC 1.81 ▲0.56%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=2ff52ae0725ba23e3470cea4b051ca8f)] confirms plans to maintain its minimum public float by using private placements, instead of conducting a second (larger) SRO. Originally, SPNEC planned the current (mini) SRO to purchase a smaller sub-portfolio of projects from its parent company, Solar Philippines, to accelerate their development through joint venture with Enrique Razon’s renewable energy companies. Then, SPNEC planned a second (larger) SRO to raise its public float back up above the minimum 20% level once the share-swap with its parent company to bring the rest of the planned portfolio over to SPNEC dilutes existing public ownership down below the acceptable threshold. MB: SPNEC could sell a minority stake to any investor, privately, to sell enough shares to satisfy the minimum public ownership requirement. There’s going to be a market for those shares, but it will be interesting to see what price they’ll be able to command for a large block. PSE investors have reacted nervously to large block sales, with negative stock performances following even some sales that were executed at a premium. This doesn’t change much, since dilution is dilution, but it does remove the chance for existing shareholders to get a second kick at the can to acquire additional shares at a discount.

>- **[UPDATE]     BPI and RBank to merge, with BPI as the surviving bank...** In a follow-up to Spot.ph’s breaking news, BPI [BPI 89.50 ▼0.56%] and JG Summit [JGS 42.05 ▼4.43%] subsidiary, RBank, confirmed their planned merger in a series of disclosures [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=b957a174833889123470cea4b051ca8f)] to the exchange on Friday afternoon. The details of the transaction are still high-level, but it appears as though BPI will pay the shareholders of RBank (JGS and Robinsons Retail Holdings [RRHI 54.70 unch]) an amount of BPI shares equivalent to approximately 6% of BPI’s outstanding stock. The proposed merger still requires positive BPI, JGS, and RRHI shareholder votes, plus regulatory approvals from the BSP, PDIC, the SEC, and a review by the Philippine Competition Commission. The rationale for the merger, as supplied in BPI’s disclosure, is to “unlock various synergies”: RBank customers gain access to the larger array of financial products offered by BPI, and BPI gains access to RBank’s deposit base and prime customer-facing branch and ATM locations within Gokongwei-owned properties. The parties said that the timetable of the merger depends on the completion of the shareholder votes and regulatory reviews.
>    - ***MB:*** *The addition of RBank’s ₱0.16 trillion in assets will give BPI just enough juice to pass the Ty Family’s Metrobank [MBT 48.50 ▼0.61%] and move into third place on the BSP’s list of the country’s largest banks by asset value. The merger, like a wedding between the offspring of two royal families, will give BPI the pulling power of two of the country’s largest and most-influential oligarchical families. In the banking game of thrones, the houses of AC and JGS are now combined. There is also the matter of GoTyme, the digital banking arm of the Gokongwei Family. Many news sources claim the Gokongweis are selling RBank in order to “focus” on GoTyme, and while that might be true, it is interesting to note that RBank itself is a 20% shareholder in GoTyme, and that BPI has, through this merger, just acquired a substantial minority stake in the Gokongwei’s digibank startup.*

>- **[COMING_UP]     Key events for the PSE this week...** This will turn out to be a pretty big week for Ayala Corp [AC 616.00 ▼4.35%], as its telecom subsidiary, Globe [GLO 2030.00 ▼2.59%], conducts its stock rights offering (SRO), and its banking subsidiary, BPI [BPI 89.50 ▼0.56%], starts to navigate the complicated approvals of a potential merger between it and Robinsons Bank. For GLO, the SRO offer period will run from today, October 3, to Friday, October 7. The SRO offer is available to all shareholders of record as of September 21, 2022. Monday is also the day that Megaworld’s [MEG 2.04 ▼3.32%] 1,572,282,881 shares in its REIT subsidiary, MREIT [MREIT 14.00 ▼0.57%], are released from mandatory lockup.
>    - ***MB:*** *Unspoken in all of this, of course, is the carnage that we’ve seen in the market. Most investors are probably thinking more about the red in their portfolios than they are about cute lockup expirations or SROs selling for ₱1,680/share. If they’re not thinking about that, they’re probably thinking about the rising cost of food and gas due to inflation, or they’re thinking about the continuing devaluation of the peso and what that might mean in the short term and in the long term. All of those lines of thought share a common focus: where does it stop? Where does the PSEi’s slide end? When will inflation come under control, and how high will rates need to rise before that is accomplished? How low will the peso go?*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **Phoenix Petroleum** [PNX 9.00 ▼4.15%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=e377ae879ec09dff3470cea4b051ca8f)] responded to the news of its bank accounts being frozen to pay a hefty outstanding debt to the LT Group [LTG 8.26 ▼1.08%] by saying that it has yet to “officially receive” copies of the complaint, summons as well as the writ of preliminary attachment that were issued by the court. PNX did say that it is “determined” to protect its rights in the “appropriate venue”. 
>      - ***MB Quick Take:*** *While PNX’s response was pretty standard in terms of what a company might say in comment to a legal issue, it’s a little odd for it to be pleading “official” ignorance of everything at the stage where the court has ordered PNX’s accounts to be frozen. Normally, the “waiting on official copies” stuff is what you see at the outset of a legal proceeding. PNX put out a second statement on the matter to say that it’s never even heard of this case outside of social media, so we’re going to have to wait and see what’s going on.*
>    - **Basic Energy** [BSC 0.29 ▼4.84%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=170d8b18bd98295a3470cea4b051ca8f)] board votes to use ₱6 million to hire a third party expert to help it evaluate and rank its seven potential wind power locations in the Philippines. 
>      - ***MB Quick Take:*** *While “location” is important when talking about both solar and wind power, wind is by far the more complicated of the two. For starters, the “wind inventory” of various parts of the country is not as widely available as the solar inventory. This makes sense because the availability of light and sun is critical to certain agricultural endeavors, and the government (and industry) has a vested interest in the study and evaluation of the solar potential of various parts of the country. Wind, not so much. To make matters worse, what might feel very windy to us at ground level might not be all that “windy” up 50 to 100 meters where the turbines are spinning (or not spinning), so it’s risky to rely on anecdotal research from non-technical observations. Worse still is the need for BSC to gain this understanding of the wind’s potential across all seasons of the year, for each of the seven regions. Considering the variables, and the sad cost of getting it wrong, it’s a good sign that BSC is going with outside experts on this initiative.*
>    - **Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Corporation** [PTT suspended]  [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=64a855cac7af2fab3470cea4b051ca8f)] tried to have its 2022 annual stockholders meeting, but failed due to lack of quorum. As noted by PTT, the company’s incumbent directors will continue to serve in their capacity until a vote can be held at some later time when a new meeting can be scheduled, and enough of the company’s shareholders actually show up to hold a vote. 
>      - ***MB Quick Take:*** *PTT really stretches the imagination of what it means to be “on” the PSE. The stock hasn’t traded in almost 20 years, and yet it still abides by the disclosure rules, dutifully notifying the market of all the comings and goings of its company, and keeping us up-to-date as to the latest quarterly net loss. How is any group served by this company remaining in this state for so long? Certainly not the minority shareholders. I don’t care too much about the owners of the company, as they have direct control over what they’re doing and have many more options on how to monetize their interests. The minority holders have far fewer options.*
>    - **DoubleDragon** [DD 6.48 ▼0.15%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=d5b4ab506e0320cd3470cea4b051ca8f)] subsidiary, Hotel 101, completes the acquisition of a 9,000 sqm property in Niseko, Japan. DD intends for the site to be home to its first international hotel, which DD hopes will be the first of many for this aspiring “global Filipino brand”. DD expects the project to generate ₱8.1 billion in condotel pre-selling sales revenue, though it did not put a timeframe on the recognition of that revenue.
>      - ***MB Quick Take:*** *DD has big goals, and its goal for Hotel 101 is to be something of a “home away from home” for traveling Filipinos. In the statement to shareholders, Injap Sia wrote that, in a few years, he hopes to see “a Hotel101 in every urban city and key destination in the Philippines and in other countries overseas.” That’s ambitious, but do-able largely because the wording of the goal gives DD a lot of wiggle room!*

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[COMING_UP]     A quick look at the week ahead...** In the 30th season of the modern Philippine Stock Exchange, this week (Week 39) is definitely going to feel like one of those filler episodes. The only thing on my calendar is on Wednesday when a bunch of Bank of Commerce [BNCOM 9.11 unch] stock, owned by BNCOM’s parent, San Miguel [SMC 97.65 unch], comes out of mandatory lock-up. There’s a low chance of something interesting happening with that.
>    - ***MB:*** *Stay safe! It’s really a fitting #WalangPasok kind of day. There’s nothing happening, so you don’t have to feel like you’re missing out on too much market-based fun while you’re stuck at home parenting kids who are also walang pasok.*

>- **[NEWS]     Dito Telecommunity passes its 3rd technical audit...** According to DITO [DITO 3.21 ▼5.31%] [link], the telco passed its 3rd technical audit while also satisfying the minimum coverage threshold for continuance under its congressional franchise. This year, DITO needed to have “covered” at least 70% of the population, at speeds averaging at least 55 mbps. DITO covered 72% of the population, and provided a minimum average speed of 71 mbps. DITO said that it received notice of its “pass” from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC).
>    - ***MB:*** *It feels a little rich to refer to its 72% coverage in such breathless terms, as though it didn’t just squeak past a coverage number that is a bare minimum. Still, a pass is a pass, and DITO can now turn its executive cycles to trying to figure out how to deal with its ballooning US Dollar-denominated debt, which looks like it will only become more of a problem for the next couple of quarters.*

>- **[UPDATE]     Rep. Joey Salceda thinks the peso could reach ₱68/$1...** Citing measures the U.S. Federal Reserve took in its fight against inflation 40 years ago, House Ways and Means Chairman, Joey Salceda [[link](https://bilyonaryo.com/2022/09/23/no-anchor-no-resistance-salceda-expects-dollar-to-reach-p65-p68-and-bbm-bso-cant-do-anything-about-it/business/)], said that there is nothing stopping the peso from free falling to ₱65-₱68 per U.S. Dollar “in the near term”, and that both the President and the BSP are helpless to do anything about it. Mr. Salceda notes that the US Fed raised interest rates by 6500 basis points in the 80s to combat inflation, and that (so far) the Fed has only raised rates 2250 basis points, implying the Fed might raise by another 4250 basis points.
>    - ***MB:*** *To take this at face value, you need to accept so many of Mr. Salceda’s unspoken assumptions. That the inputs are the same (they’re not; annual inflation is nothing near what it was in the early 80s and there isn’t an unemployment problem), that the Fed started from the same point (it didn’t), and that the Philippines and it’s currency are in the same position relative to the US Dollar (it isn’t). It also depends on how you define “near term” (Mr. Salceda’s definition seems pretty loose), I’m not saying that he’s wrong, I’m just outlining the ways that his off-the-cuff remakes might not be accurate. He’s right that the BSP hasn’t traditionally used interest rates as part of its tool kit to bolster the peso’s value, though. If this really were a repeat of the early 80s then we are in for a wild ride: the Philippine Peso went from being worth ₱7.5/$1 in 1980, to ₱16.7/$1 by 1984.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **Go Negosyo** [[link](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/09/22/2211287/finding-balance-work-life-and-economy/amp/)] founder, Joey Concepcion, said that private businesses should be able to determine their own work-from-home policies free of government intervention. Mr. Concepcion said that each business would know best how its operations could and should be administered by a combination of on-site and off-site workers. 
>      - ***MB Quick Take***: *This is common sense, though a little misleading as the issue for some companies is that certain tax advantages were granted based on butts-in-chairs headcount numbers. Resolve that contractual issue, and I’m with Joey (for once): let the businesses decide. It will be an uphill battle, as all the lolos-as-owners are still very old-fashioned and suspicious of work-from-home, which is super frustrating.*
>    - **The Keepers** [KEEPR 1.15 ▼0.86%] [[link](https://mb.com.ph/2022/09/22/co-earns-p1-5-b-from-keepers-acquisition/)] owner, Lucio Co, will make ₱1.5 billion by causing KEEPR to purchase his family’s personal stake in a Spanish liquor company. As reported by Manila Bulletin, Co purchased the stake in 2018 for ₱1.5 billion, and will double his money using KEEPR shareholder funds. Abacus raised questions about the windfall for Co, noting that the acquisition implies a much higher valuation for the shares than when Co bought the stake just 4 years ago, despite not much changing for the company’s performance in that time. 
>      - ***MB Quick Take***: *A majority stake is worth more than a minority stake, but not THAT much more. This is another great example of the conflicts of interest that shareholders need to be vigilant about. It seems like this purchase will be net positive for KEEPR, but is there a better use of the money that will provide greater benefits to shareholders? The benefits to Lucio Co are pretty obvious.*
>    - **NEDA** [[link](https://manilastandard.net/news/314262561/neda-pamasko-to-bolster-peso.html)] said that “pamasko” in the form of remittances will “bolster” the peso in Q4. NEDA Undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon said the peso’s shocking devaluation was “likely temporary”, and that Christmas gift remittances would prop up the peso in November and December. 
>      - ***MB Quick Take***: *I don’t know what it is about this dumb little bit of news that got me going, but I did a quick survey of Q2 and Q4 P/$ exchange rates over the last 12 years to see if this peso-is-stronger-in-Q4 thing holds true. My methods were pretty casual (eyeballing a 10-year chart), but the results were not encouraging. The peso was stronger in Q4 than it was in Q2 in 5 years (2010-2012, 2019-2020), and weaker (often significantly) in 7 years (2013-2018, 2021-2022). I don't know if it's so obvious that the peso will have an easier time in Q4 """"because remittances.""*

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[UP NEXT]    What to expect out of the week of September 12-16 on the UP NEXT  What to expect out of the week of September 12-16 on the PSE...** Not a huge week by absolute standards, but relative to what we’ve all survived through August, this one is going to feel resoundingly “medium”. None of the inflation or interest rate fireworks that we’re going to watch later on next week, as the US Fed first meets to decide what action it will take on interest rates in the US, and then our own BSP (taking direction from what the US Fed elects to do) will meet the next day to do the same. This week is all about Thursday and Friday. 
>- **➤ Thursday: SPNEC SRO listing:** Solar Philippines [SPNEC 1.56 unch] lists the 1,875,649,995 shares it sold at ₱1.50/share as part of its stock rights offering (SRO). *MB: Retail “bought-in” and purchased all the shares in the first two rounds of the SRO, but what will the market price be when the shares finally list on Thursday? Will the price have a psychological impact on the shareholders that bought the SRO?*
>- **➤ Thursday: PSE “Road to IPO”:** The PSE is presenting a one-day conference on all things IPO, from a look ahead into the IPO market of the near future, to some of the country’s biggest players making the case for why an IPO could be a “key strategic initiative’, to “IPO Readiness Tips” from some of the country’s most-experienced professional advisors. *MB: This is a great way to get into the brains of owners, to get a better feel for the incentives at play when a company comes to market. Check out the roster of presenters: it’s really top-notch. There is a lot of experience on this panel of speakers. Checkout the PSE website for registration info.*
>- **➤ Thursday: RCR lockup ends:** The ~6 billion RL Commercial REIT [RCR 6.08 ▲1.33%] shares, held by RCR’s parent, Robinsons Land [RLC 18.72 ▼0.43%], will be released from lockup on Wednesday afternoon, and will be active for trading by Thursday morning. *MB: As discussed previously, I don’t expect to see any drip-selling from RLC, but that’s one monster block of shares, and conditions on the ground have changed significantly since the IPO this time last year.*
>- **➤ Friday: GLO SRO ex-date:** Anyone looking to participate in the Globe [GLO 2090.00 ▼1.60%] ₱1,680.00/share stock rights offering will need to own GLO stock before Friday. GLO stock purchased on Friday will not include any attached right to participate in the SRO. *MB: Ex-dates and record dates can be confusing, but the key here is that the only stock that you can use to participate in the SRO is stock that you bought before the end-of-day on Thursday, that you still own on the 21st.*
>    - ***MB:*** *It’s nice to feel that things are picking up again, and in a way that is somewhat forward-looking. The SPNEC and GLO SROs are equity raises with a growth mindset; both companies are cashing-up to buy and build for the future. The RCR thing is more procedural in nature, but the PSE’s IPO conference is a nice way to set the stage for the flourish of IPOs that we’ll hopefully have to end 2022, headlined by the behemoth: Enrique Razon’s Prime Infra. Lots of interesting stories to be told in the coming weeks!*

>- **[UPDATE]     Globe sets SRO price at 20% discount to current price...** Globe Telecom [GLO 2090.00 ▼1.60%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=0beadd0dd06b95a73470cea4b051ca8f)] set its stock rights offering (SRO) price at ₱1,680/share, with an entitlement ratio of 1 SRO share for every 13.2366 existing GLO shares owned. GLO will sell 10,119,047 shares and raise ₱17 billion through this transaction. While the price is at a 20% discount to GLO’s closing price on Friday, the SRO price represents a 22.6% discount from GLO’s 30-day volume weighted average price, as calculated on September 8th.
>    - ***MB:*** *The discount is on the higher-end of the range provided by GLO (15-25%), but participation will not come “cheap”. With an entitlement ratio of 1:13.2366, that means that even if you owned 1,000 shares of GLO (worth ₱2.09 million as of Friday’s close), you’d only get the chance to buy 75 SRO shares. You’d pay ₱126,000 for those shares, which would be worth ₱156,750 at market. You’d get about ₱30,000 of value off of ₱2 million in shareholdings. This kind of SRO definitely benefits significant shareholders more than it does retail minority holders. That’s not necessarily a  bad thing, It’s just what happens when an entitlement ratio is large and the underlying stock price is significant.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **AREIT** [AREIT 38.75 ▼0.39%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=0948f87cb8b1b9fa3470cea4b051ca8f)] listing of 483 million shares issued to Ayala Land [ALI 27.80 unch] was approved by the PSE, with a mandatory 180-day lock-up that prevents ALI from selling or transferring those shares until March 7, 2023. ***MB Quick Take:*** *These were shares that were issued to ALI out of AREIT’s authorized (but unissued) shares, which AREIT used as payment to acquire properties from ALI. The shares were already counted as “outstanding” for the purposes of dilution and AREIT’s share price when the shares were officially transferred; this transaction simply registers the ALI-owned shares with the PSE’s system and makes them (theoretically) tradeable. Well, I guess not until the shares come out of lock-up!*
>    - **Raslag** [ASLAG 2.25 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=6e4e8033da1bad593470cea4b051ca8f)] buy-back boys are at it again! ASLAG’s chairman and director, through their privately-owned holding company, T.G.N. Realty Corporation (TGN), purchased 500,000 shares of ASLAG on Thursday, for an average price of just under ₱2.27/share. ***MB Quick Take:*** *On some days, this kind of insider buying is hardly noticeable, as TGN’s buying activity takes up a super-small proportion of the day’s total sales volume in ASLAG stock. But, on other days, like that Thursday, TGN’s activity can “feel” far more significant: its purchases accounted for 10% of the shares traded on that day. ASLAG shareholders are probably pretty excited by the ownership group’s willingness to buy its stock back at a premium to its ₱2.00/share IPO price, but at some point, the well will run dry. It will be interesting to see if ASLAG will maintain its momentum once the ownership group runs out of public float runway to conduct further insider purchases.*
>    - **Prime Infra** [PFR 14.60 pre-SEC] [[link](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/09/12/2208954/prime-infrastructure-starts-p28-billion-ipo-roadshow)] in the middle of its “anchor roadshow”, where the underwriters and PFR’s owners have meetings with potential large (anchor) investors to get a feel for the market’s demand for PFR shares. The group has held meetings with potential investors in Singapore, Malaysia, and Manila, and will be holding meetings in the US and UK this week. ***MB Quick Take:*** *Ever heard of the saying, “it’s worth what someone is willing to pay for it”? Well, that’s what’s happening here. They’re stomping around all the big-money centers, armed with a slide deck, nice suits, and plenty of coffee, and they’re trying to see what these groups will pay for the shares. Nearly everyone they speak with will be interested, but “interest” is on a sliding scale of price. The key is to find the highest price that will predictably sell all of the shares that need to be sold. Too under-valued, and Enrique Razon will end up leaving a lot of money on the table. Too over-valued, and investors may be turned-off by prolonged poor performance. These are serious meetings with very important implications for the price of the IPO going forward.*

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[UPDATE]     iPeople to list shares from merger with AC Education tomorrow...** iPeople [IPO 7.00 ▼3.05%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=d41954823d754d033470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed that it will be listing the 295,329,976 new IPO shares that it issued to Ayala Corp [AC 620.00 ▲1.64%] as part of the merger between IPO and AC Education Inc (ACEI). The merger itself was initiated way back in 2018. The shares that will be listed have already been considered as part of IPO’s outstanding shares for some time now, so their listing won’t impact the IPO share price or the proportional ownership of the company. IPO is a subsidiary of House of Investments [HI 3.40 unch], which is a Yuchengco Family company.
>    - ***MB:*** *This is the last step in what turned out to be a very lengthy process of merging IPO and ACEI. While this isn’t really a material development in the IPO/ACEI merger (it’s really just a technicality), it’s hard to ignore how often the Yuchengo family name has surfaced in the news recently. The family has fingers in a lot of influential pies, and it’s worth watching to see how their various interests might be “activated” to pursue new opportunities.*

>- **[NEWS]     Philippine National Bank president resigns to assume new government post...** Philippine National Bank [PNB 18.00 ▲0.45%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=820e59dc5849f0673470cea4b051ca8f)] was forced to appoint an officer-in-charge, Florido Casuela, after its previous President, Wick Veloso, resigned from the company in order to assume a new government post as the head of the Government Service Insurance System. Mr. Veloso’s resignation was effective as of July 5th, and Mr. Casuela’s OIC appointment took effect on the same date. As a director of PNB, Mr. Casuela is no stranger to the bank (he’s the chairman of PNB Securities), and will assist the board in searching for permanent appointment for Mr. Veloso’s vacated Presidency. PNB is the banking arm of Lucio Tan’s group of companies.
>    - ***MB:*** *Mr. Veloso started as PNB’s President back in 2018, when PNB was trading at ₱30/share. After a period where PNB’s share price jumped up to the ₱40-45/share range in 2019, the stock price has since slid consistently to the point where it’s now in the ₱17/share level, down over 40% from when he assumed the leadership role. That’s not to say that Mr. Veloso didn’t try some outside-of-the-box tricks to bring value to shareholders, an approach best exemplified by PNB’s declaration of property dividends in 2021 for shares in a subsidiary property holding company. Sure, it’s been a year since that declaration and PNB shareholders are still waiting for news on when those divs will be paid, but I got the impression that Mr. Veloso was doing the best that he could with the hand that he was dealt.*

>- **[Q&A]     How does your REIT “Buying Power” metric work?...** I’ve had a few questions on this, and I think I didn’t do a great job explaining what this is about. Allow me this second chance! The Buying Power metric is meant to quickly (and roughly) estimate the maximum value that a REIT might be able to purchase, using all of its available debt and equity resources, without exceeding the debt cap or dropping below the 33.33% minimum public ownership requirement. To help illustrate this, let me compare AREIT [AREIT 37.60 ▲2.73%] and RL Commercial REIT [RCR 6.49 ▲0.93%]. The MB REIT Tracker has AREIT with a Buying Power of around ₱28 billion, while RCR has a Buying Power of around ₱40 billion. But what accounts for the big difference? On the debt side of the Buying Power metric, both AREIT and RCR are able to borrow up to 70% of the value of their deposited properties (they're the only two REITs that are able to exceed the default 35% cap because of their PRS Aaa debt rating), but AREIT already has ₱7.8 billion in liabilities against ₱50 billion in deposited property, while RCR only has ₱1.5 billion in liabilities against ₱59 billion in deposited properties. That difference right there accounts for a huge difference in Buying Power. Using debt, AREIT could use about ₱27 billion to buy properties, while RCR can use closer to ₱40 billion. On the equity side, AREIT has 33.64% of its outstanding shares in public hands, which gives it the ability to issue only about 29 million “new” shares as part of a property-for-shares swap before it would need to conduct some kind of new sale of shares to the public. That amount is worth about ₱1 billion. RCR has a public ownership of 36.51%, so it could issue 1,058 million shares, worth about ₱6.1 billion to buy properties before being forced to conduct some similar sale of shares to the public. Put that debt amount together with the equity amount, and you have AREIT being able to “spend” about ₱28 billion, and RCR being able to “spend” about ₱46 billion.
>    - ***MB:*** *RCR’s pending acquisition of the Cyberscape Gamma building from Robinsons Land [RLC 17.28 ▲2.61%], which it will purchase using new shares, is a great example of the usefulness of the Buying Power metric. When the transaction is complete, the 777,807,133 shares that will issue to RLC will bring RCR’s public ownership down to 33.86%, and it will reduce the equity portion of RCR’s Buying Power from around ₱6 billion to a little under ₱1 billion. The addition of the Cyberscape Gamma building will add another ₱6 billion to the value of RCR’s deposited properties, which should also give it access to an additional ₱4 billion in debt under its 70% limit. The net result of the transaction would see RCR’s Buying Power drop from ₱40 billion to ₱39 billion (minus ₱5 billion in equity buying power, plus ₱4 billion in debt buying power). I don’t know if this kind of stat is used in other jurisdictions. I made this up myself, to provide a better perspective on the capabilities of each of the REITs, but I am very open to feedback on ways to make this statistic better or more accurate. Hope that helps!*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **PetroEnergy Resources** [PERC 4.68 ▼3.51%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=3ed71396b9ca20183470cea4b051ca8f)] received DOE and DENR approvals for two new solar projects. The Yuchengco Family’s energy arm disclosed that it is nearing a final investment decision on the two projects, pending “closing of on-going discussions with selected contractors and project lender”. This is a family that can move quickly, and is one to watch.
>    - **Raslag** [ASLAG 2.02 ▲1.51%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=e0f4779bfa98f6133470cea4b051ca8f)] ended its stabilization period in positive territory. The stab fund was active throughout the period, as ASLAG struggled at times to hold on to its post-IPO gains. The ability of the company’s directors to perform the same stabilization role will be constrained by ASLAG’s shrinking public ownership percentage.
>    - **BSP** [[link](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/07/06/bsp-experts-inflation-to-stay-elevated-ahead/)] to consider bigger interest rate hikes to tackle inflation. June inflation came in at 6.1%, and the BSP said that inflation will remain “elevated” for “the coming months”. Analysts think that inflation has not yet peaked, and that even if it peaks in October/November of this year, it will remain elevated for the remainder of 2022 and well into 2023. Commodity prices are the main driver of this inflation.

> - **[NEWS]** **Eagle Cement up 21% on news of potential tender offer from SMC...** 
> Eagle Cement [EAGLE 18.56 ▲20.52%], owned by Ramon Ang, surged to an intraday high of ₱19.70/share on news that San Miguel [SMC 99.00 ▲2.43%], owned by Ramon Ang, had approved the purchase of 88.5% of EAGLE’s outstanding shares at a price of ₱22.02/share. The change in control of EAGLE, from one entity owned by Mr. Ang to another owned by Mr. Ang, would require SMC to conduct a tender offer for the remaining shares in the public float. The tender offer price would be at the same price that SMC paid for the EAGLE shares. Investor enthusiasm for EAGLE wilted slightly as the day progressed.
>     - **► Why did the price spike so high?** Some investors are buying EAGLE for the chance to sell the shares back to SMC at ₱22.02/share.  
>     - **► Why didn’t the price end up at ₱22.02/share?** It’s not an absolute certainty that the tender offer will happen, and there are a number of factors that could make someone think twice. How will the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) react? Will they block the acquisition, just as they did when SMC tried to buy Holcim [HLCM 4.20 ▲10.53%] back in 2020? Even if the regulatory hurdles are overcome, SMC hasn’t provided a timeline for the transaction, or more specifically, a timeline for when the tender offer will occur. HLCM went from ₱9.50/share in March up to ₱15.30/share the day the acquisition was announced. Almost exactly one year later, after the PCC rejected the acquisition and SMC officially withdrew its acquisition bid, HLCM’s stock price was back down to ₱7.77/share. While there can be great rewards in playing this tender offer game, the risks are real! 
>     - **► How likely is it the deal will complete?** It’s hard to tell, but if we take EAGLE’s price before the announcement, ₱15.40/share, and measure how close to the tender offer price of ₱22.02/share the market price got, we can kind of get a rough idea of the probability of the deal going through. Theoretically, if the market thought there would be zero chance the deal would happen, EAGLE’s price wouldn’t move at all, and if the market was absolutely certain that it would go through, the price would rise to ₱22.02/share. That the price “only” reached ₱18.56/share implies a 48% chance of deal 
completion.  
>     - **► What about the PCC?** This one is interesting to me, since back when the PCC blocked SMC’s acquisition of HLCM, it did so in partial reliance on the understanding that the Luzon market for cement considered SMC’s subsidiary, First Stronghold Cement, and EAGLE to be “sister companies” with like control, such that EAGLE was not an effective, arms-reach competitor to First Stronghold. SMC argued, at that time, that EAGLE was an entirely separate company with its own management, and that it was independent of SMC’s leadership. That line of argument would have given SMC the best chance to acquire HLCM back in the day, but will it work against SMC now in its attempt to acquire EAGLE? If SMC and EAGLE are separate and independent, then SMC’s acquisition of EAGLE may have a material impact on consumers of cement in the region.
>     - **MB BOTTOM-LINE:** The implied chance of success isn’t some crystal ball of prediction; as time passes and we learn new bits of information, the market will consume those bits, people will buy and sell, and EAGLE’s price will change. That will cause the implied chance of success to change. Regardless of EAGLE’s exact price, there’s clearly some hesitancy on the part of investors to jump in with two feet as though it’s a done deal with no risk. SMC has made the PCC review sound like something that is merely administrative, triggered only by the size of the deal itself, but I’m not so sure that’s how investors are looking at it just yet. The PCC took a very detailed look at the cement market, and I have no reason to think that they’d approach this deal any differently. They’re a group that can’t be rushed, and that isn’t vulnerable to lazy, convenient thinking. 

>- **[NOTES] Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **Aboitiz Equity Ventures** [AEV 56.90 ▲1.97%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=bcb21532264819e33470cea4b051ca8f)] entered into an agreement with a company called EdgeConnex to create two joint ventures for the purpose of “building, operating, and maintaining a platform of data center facilities in the Philippines”. The agreement was signed through AEV’s subsidiary, Aboitiz InfraCapital (AIC).
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *The Aboitiz Family seems to be doing whatever it can to make business hay while the political sun is shining. I think that “data centers” are kind of an amorphous business at this stage, much like the concept of a “cell tower”. How much does a data center cost? How profitable is one to run? Is there a market for common data centers, as there is for cell towers? My feeling is that there is, and that we may one day see a PSE REIT focused on acquiring and running data centers. These are just the seeds being planted for later harvest.*
>    - **AyalaLand Logistics** [ALLHC 3.25 ▲1.56%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=95daa7e1c6973dcb3470cea4b051ca8f)] entered into agreements with a company called FLOW Digital Infrastructure to develop and operate “carrier-neutral” data centers across the country. The two parties had signed a framework agreement back in May, but this agreement is the implementing agreement of the joint venture. No specific details were made available. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *Looks like everyone is leveling up their capacity by grabbing a foreign dance partner to build supply into this market for data centers. How deep the market is for data centers, and how profitable the business plan for their operation, I do not know yet. But it’s clear that the bigshots think there’s some gold at the end of the data center rainbow.*
>    - **Inflation** [[link](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/10/06/2214537/bsp-ready-act-further-vs-quickening-inflation)] for September “quickened” to 6.9%, up from 6.3% in August. While this was within the BSP’s “expected range” of between 6.6% to 7.4%, the average inflation from January through September was at 5.1%, which is well above the central bank’s annual target range of 2.0% to 4.0%. The most significant driver of September inflation was the cost of food.
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *There are enough people calling for even higher inflation in October that it seems highly unlikely that this ugly inflation showing is the “peak”. How bad will October be? Will the storm’s impact be negligible, as the Asian Development Bank seems to think, or will the supply chain disruptions work to drive prices up even further? If October’s inflation is worse than September’s, how aggressive will the BSP be in raising rates? Some have said that the September result makes a “twin raise” of 50 basis points in November and December much more likely. With the peso at/near all-time lows, what the BSP does over the next couple of months could have a dramatic impact on our currency’s value. An aggressive BSP raise will continue to hold the REIT sector’s head in the toilet, while a limp or underwhelming response might take the peso out at the knees and further expose PSE companies with US debt to even more pain.*

>- **[NEWS]     Prime Infra files for ₱28.2-B IPO in October...** 
>    - **The deal:** Prime Infrastructure Capital [[link](https://primeinfra.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Prime-Infra-Draft-Preliminary-Prospectus-June-17-2022.pdf)], the private infrastructure holding company of Enrique Razon, has filed an application with the SEC to conduct an IPO to sell just over 1.9 billion common shares for a maximum price of ₱14.60/share, to raise ₱28.2 billion. The offer includes 1,755,780,000 primary common shares, plus 175,578,000 primary over-allotment shares. The proceeds of the sale of the over-allotment shares will be used by the stabilization agent to operate the stabilization fund. Assuming full exercise of the over-allotment option, the IPO will transfer 22% of the company into public hands.
>    - **The ticker symbol:** The prospectus says that the company’s ticker symbol will be “PFR”, which seems like an odd choice considering the initials of the company’s name are “PIC”. I get that their range of choices is limited by the existence of Prime Media Holdings [PRIM 3.11 ▲6.51%], and SM Prime [SMPH 36.45 ▼1.22%], both of which incorporate some form of “PRIME” into their legal name, and in the case of PRIM, leaves the full “PRIME” available for use but at the risk of potential confusion. I agree that “PIC” is probably not representative of Prime Infra’s business, but neither does “PFR”. “PFR” is also pretty close to “PFRS”, which is a super-common term that we see all the time in financial statements because it stands for “Philippine Financial Reporting Standards”. My suggestion (which always comes free of charge) is to go with “PNFRA”, which is at least like a vanity license plate style reference to the company’s common name, “Prime Infra”. But I’ll use PFR until the Razons can see the light!
>    - **The bankers:** CLSA Limited is the sole global coordinator, with BPI Capital [BPI 92.60 ▼0.96%] and BDO Capital [BDO 123.00 ▲0.16%] acting as joint local underwriters. The prospectus did not name the stabilization agent, but it’s not uncommon for this to get updated in the final version of the prospectus.
>    - **The business:** PFR is Enrique Razon’s private holding company. PFR is to Enrique Razon as Udenna is to Dennis Uy, except that, here, Enrique Razon plans to actually sell a stake in his private holdco to the general public, and open his books to us as part of that process. PFR operates four major segments: water, energy, construction, and waste. While all four segments are operational, the two most interesting are the water and energy segments. The water division is dominated by Trident Water, which Barkadans will remember from the Tubigserye back in 2019/2020, where Mr. Razon used Trident Water as the acquiring entity when he swooped in to scoop up a controlling interest in Manila Water [MWC 16.40 ▼1.56%] from the Ayalas. The energy division is no less ambitious, and is involved in several hydro and solar projects, including large joint ventures with Solar Philippines (the parent company of Solar Philippines NEC [SPNEC 1.56 ▼0.64%]), which will become a part of SPNEC after the share-swap is completed.
>    - **Primary/secondary split:** “Primary” shares are new shares in PFR that are sold by PFR, and that money raised is for PFR’s use. “Secondary” shares are existing shares sold by private shareholders, and that money raised is for those private shareholders to use, not the company. In this case, the entire deal is primary -- even the over-allotment shares are primary, which is very unusual. This means that PFR will gain the use of over ₱28.2 billion. That leaves about ₱27.6 billion after fees are deducted for PFR to use to grow its businesses. That’s pretty interesting. 
>    - **Use of proceeds:** PFR plans to sink ₱23 billion into its energy business. That’s 83% of the net proceeds, so that’s what this whole IPO thing is “about”. Of that ₱23 billion, ₱10.5 billion will be spent in 2022, ₱9.9 billion will be spent in 2023, and ₱2.6 billion will be spent in 2024. This is a very front-loaded deal, which means that investors are likely to get the benefit of their investment earlier.
>    - **What are the risks?** PFR self-identifies that its greatest risk is the general economic well-being of the Philippines. PFR says that its growth is driven by the growth of the Philippine economy, and that some of its contracts (especially in the water segment) may be exposed to inflation in a way that PFR will not be in a position to be made completely whole under the agreements as they stand. PFR also said that all of its businesses exist within heavily regulated industries, and may rely on certain tax or other benefits that are, as inferred by this section, subject to the Government’s changing attitudes and initiatives.
>    - ***MB:*** *There is no mistaking the size and importance of this IPO. Based on the deal’s current size and price, if it went through as it is today, PFR would be the 2nd largest IPO in PSE history. Nothing like the behemoth that was the Monde Nissin [MONDE 13.44 ▲1.97%] IPO, which raised over ₱48 billion, but every-so-slightly larger than the previous heavyweight champ, Robinsons Retail Holdings [RRHI 47.00 ▲1.40%], which raised ₱28 billion. As I mentioned in the “use of proceeds” section, this IPO is clearly about energy. The vast majority of the proceeds will be put into this business segment, with over ₱20 billion scheduled to be pumped into the energy segment by the end of 2023. For the solar projects that it will be developing with SPNEC and others, PFR will be able to begin commercial operations pretty quickly (by energy standards) and give the benefit of those operating facilities to shareholders. It’s interesting that 100% of this raise is primary. It’s interesting that the most aggressive (and successful) oligarch over the past two years is bringing his personal holdco to market. How does PFR compare to the other infra holdcos on the market right now? How will the market look in four months’ time when this thing actually lists? These are all questions that we can answer over the coming days, weeks, and months, but that we will need to address to get a better understanding of the potential opportunity that this IPO presents.*

This is the first tranche of the ₱15 billion shelf-registration, and will offer bonds with “indicative maturities ranging from 3.5 to 7 years”. Maybe it’s a good time for companies to take on debt like this before market rates rise significantly?
>    - **AllDay Marts** [ALLDY 0.32 ▼5.97%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=c43450df1edefd063470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed that 2.6. billion shares held by Manny Villar’s private holdco will come out of mandatory lockup on June 25, and will be available for trading on June 27. I don’t expect Mr. Villar to be a seller on the 27th, but it’s worth checking. Even though ALLDY is down 48% since its IPO, trading at just ₱0.32/share, [Mr. Villar only paid ₱0.10/share](https://mailchi.mp/20313f338f50/us-based-kkr-behind-the-tender-offer-for-fgen-shares?e=933945058a) for the shares that are coming out of lockup. So he’s still sitting on a 220% gain. I’m not saying, I’m just saying.

The board also approved publication of the Introductory Document, which serves as a prospectus for the IPO by way of introduction. Maybe I’m missing something, but I still don’t see how many shares EMP is selling, and how much they plan to raise by doing so.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[LEARN]     Stabilization Funds 101...** 
>    - ***➤ What is it?*** A stabilization fund (“stab fund”) is a pool of money that the stabilization agent (“stab agent”) can use to help push up the price of an IPO for a month, or until the pool of money is exhausted, whichever comes first. The stab agent can only use the stab fund to buy shares below the IPO offer price, so it should be seen as a defensive (loss lessening) measure as opposed to an offensive (gain maximizing) feature. The amount of a stab fund is usually about 10% of the base/firm offer. 
>    - ***➤ Where does the money come from?*** The over-allotment shares are sold at the IPO offer price to institutional investors, and the proceeds from this sale are considered the stab fund, which is then transferred to the stab agent before the IPO. Over-allotment options are almost always secondary shares that are being sold by one or more of the owners of the company that is going public. 
>    - ***➤ How does a stab fund work?*** The stab agent uses the stab fund money to purchase shares of the IPO on the open market that are being offered for less than the IPO asking price. By purchasing these shares, the stab agent fills the role of “willing buyer” for IPO stock sellers that are looking to get rid of their shares.
>    - ***➤ Does a stab fund push the price above the IPO offer price?*** No. The stab fund only buys shares when the asking price is below the IPO offer price. The stab agent cannot use stab fund money to buy shares above the IPO offer price. The purpose of the fund is to increase the stability of the IPO’s price through purchasing stock from sellers that are willing to sell below the IPO offer price.
>    - ***➤ Does a stab fund protect against loss?*** No. It’s possible for the price of an IPO stock to fall well below the IPO offer price on the first day of trading, and to remain at a negative price for the duration of the stabilization period. It is up to the stab agent to deploy the limited stab fund money that it has to support the price, but the stab agent isn’t required to act. The stab agent isn’t required to spend stab funds like a robot and buy every single block of shares being sold below the IPO offer price. The stab agent has wide discretion in its use of the funds, and has to use its judgment as to best deploy the very limited amount of money at its disposal. 
>    - ***➤ Is it bad if the company doesn’t have a stab fund?*** Not necessarily. I think of a stab fund like a little insurance policy. It doesn’t protect against the full loss that I might incur as an IPO investor, but it (in theory) temporarily helps to reduce the downward pressure of a post-IPO sell-off. There have been many IPOs that have performed very well without having a stab fund, like Solar Philippines NEC [SPNEC 1.56 ▼0.64%], and several IPOs that have performed terribly that went public without a stab fund, like Medilines Distributors [MEDIC 0.58 ▼13.43%]. Would a stab fund have prevented MEDIC from falling 75% over the last six months? Probably not, but it might have made the first few weeks temporarily less painful. 
>    - ***➤ What is a stab fund good for?*** Liquidity. A stab fund can provide the demand needed for an investor to sell a large number of IPO shares at a better price. But that support/demand isn’t certain. There’s a chance, as with Raslag [ASLAG 1.62 ▼6.36%], that the stab agent will choose to sit on the sidelines and watch as the sellers dominate and the price of the IPO tumbles in the first few days of trading. There’s a chance that the stab agent will aggressively deploy the stab fund in the early days of the offering to keep the stock price very tight to the IPO offer price, as with AllHome [HOME 4.47 ▼3.25%], only to run out of money before the end of the month and expose the stock price fully to the natural push and pull of the market.
>    - ***➤ What happens to the stab fund at the end of the period?*** The stab agent returns any leftover money (the proceeds of the original sale of the over-allotment shares) to the owners that wrote the over-allotment option, and returns any of the shares that it purchased during the stab fund period to the owners. The stab agent collects a fee (a percentage of the original stab fund amount) for conducting the stab fund activities. 
>    - ***➤ Is this selfless on the part of the owners?*** Not really, they get something out of this, too. Remember the original over-allotment option? That’s really just a nicer-sounding way of selling secondary shares. If the IPO is successful and the stab fund is not utilized, the owners just get all the proceeds from the sale of over-allotment option in cash. If the price tanked and the stab agent needed to use some of that money to buy shares, then the owners just get to pocket the difference from the IPO price (that they sold the shares for) and the stab fund purchase price.
>    - ***MB:*** *This is another one of those finance things that is very simple when zoomed out, but that gets more complicated and nuanced the closer you look and the more you zoom in. The big picture is that a stability fund helps to temporarily protect IPO investors from the full downside risk of their investment. But zooming in, that’s when things get interesting. This protection isn’t forever. It isn’t complete. It isn’t even predictable in terms of how it will be used. It’s a nice-to-have, but definitely not something that I would count on as a potential IPO investor. At best, the presence of a stab fund increases my ability to quickly exit a bad IPO in the first few days, at a better price than I might normally get without the stab agent prowling the market. It doesn’t guarantee that I won’t lose money, and it doesn’t guarantee that I’ll be able to exit quickly or at a better price. It just potentially softens the losses, and potentially increases the chances that I can exit at a price that is maybe better than what I would have received unassisted by the fund’s artificial demand.*

>- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **VistaREIT** [VREIT 1.71 ▼0.58%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=f723123e1ee1eb963470cea4b051ca8f)] still has tax declarations and Condominium Certificates of Title pending with regulators. The stock still traded within the same pattern of “opening flash-crash”, followed by modest recovery and a late “push” to close the price up. Stock still feels heavy. Still waiting for an update from the stabilization agent to see how much lifting they’ve had to do to keep the stock from drifting lower. My feeling is: “quite a bit”.
>    - **Aboitiz Power** [AP 29.00 ▼0.51%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=adc8df058aeb01ef3470cea4b051ca8f)] was penalized ₱8.4 million by the Energy Regulatory Commission for exceeding the allowable outage days (6.8 days) for its power plants owned and operated by AP’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Hedcor Bukidnon. The run-of-river hydro facilities were damaged by flood, and required 102 days of “excess unplanned outage” to repair. AP will appeal the penalty, but the amount is really just salt on the much larger wound which was losing all of those days of electricity production. This is a risk for run-of-river systems, and worth keeping an eye on to see if changing weather patterns could expose this project (and others) to similar outages in the future.
>    - **SM Investments** [SM 785.00 ▼3.03%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=24511d9e990ab84e3470cea4b051ca8f)] announced that it incorporated a subsidiary in Singapore (SMIC SG Holdings Pte. Ltd.). The subsidiary is registered as an investment holding company, and exists to take “potential minority stakes” in foreign companies. Analysts, like Chris Mangun with AAA Equities, think that this is part of SM’s strategy to diversify its portfolio outside of the Philippines and China. All the big conglos are doing it and in that regard, SM is showing up a little bit late to the “growth outside of PH and China” party.
>    - **Inflation** [[link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp)] is going to be the talk of 2022. Generally, there are two types of inflation; (1) “demand-pull” inflation, which is when demand exceeds the supply of products or assets, and (2) “cost-push” inflation, which is when higher input prices (labor, commodities) get passed on to consumers through higher product prices. Raising interest rates is a way to address demand-pull inflation, since raising the cost of “renting” money to buy stuff makes people and corporations less likely to buy stuff, but it doesn’t really change the demand for things like fuel, food, or essential components, like microchips, that are increasing in cost due to supply chain issues. Raising the cost of renting money doesn’t make a microchip less scarce, or suddenly increase wheat production. The cost-push inflation in food, for example, will probably not be impacted by the moves by central banks to raise interest rates.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[IPO]     North Star Meat Merchants [NSTAR 10.00 pre-SEC] aims to be country’s “cold chain backbone”...** As promised, here’s a closer look at NSTAR’s preliminary prospectus that it submitted to the SEC as part of its application for a July IPO. NSTAR is owned by Anthony Ng, who [created the company as part of his “Entrepreneurial Management” thesis](https://nsmmi.com.ph/about-us/) at UAAP in 1999. The company describes itself as the “largest pork and beef vendor in Modern Trade Channels in the Philippines.” Modern Trade is an industry term for chain-owned grocery stores of all sizes, from mini-marts to hyper-marts.
>  - **The IPO deal:** The NSTAR IPO offer consists of 450 million common shares, at a tentative price of ₱10.00/share, to raise ₱4.5 billion. NSTAR itself will sell 360 million primary shares, and a major shareholder (Golden MJTF Holdings, [owned by NSTAR’s vice chairman](https://business.inquirer.net/343973/entrepreneur-turns-college-meat-shop-thesis-into-p4-5b-ipo)) will sell 90 million shares (32 million as part of the basic IPO offer, and an additional 58 million as part of the over-allotment option). After the IPO, the public will own 25% of NSTAR, assuming full exercise of the over-allotment option. The company is aiming to list in the middle of this year on the main board. BDO Capital is the issue manager. There will be a stabilization fund.
>  - **Primary/secondary split:** Only about 8% of the basic IPO offer (called the “firm offer”) is secondary, meaning that the money raised by selling those secondary shares will go to the selling shareholder (Miguel Tan, through Golden MJTF Holdings). The remainder of the firm offer is all primary, meaning that the money raised will go directly to NSTAR itself to grow its business. The firm offer excludes the over-allotment option, which is made up of secondary shares, so when we include this in the calculation, the total split jumps to 20% secondary. That’s still very reasonable. This is not a cash-out transaction like we saw with Virgilio Villar’s Medilines Distributors [MEDIC 0.86 ▲1.18%], where 32% of the IPO was secondary (cash directly to Virgilio Villar), and none of those secondary shares were sold as part of an over-allotment option stabilization fund. It was all just “straight to pocket’ without giving investors any benefit. Still, 20% is not nothing, but at least the majority of the secondary shares are going toward a stabilization fund that will help IPO investors in the first month.
>  - **Use of proceeds:** NSTAR will receive approximately ₱3.48 billion in proceeds from the IPO. Remember, NSTAR doesn’t get any money for secondary share sales, and any proceeds that NSTAR can apply to cool new things have to be “net” of the fees incurred by NSTAR to banks and the PSE for conducting its IPO. NSTAR will put ₱2 billion towards “working capital”, which it plans to use to increase its contract-buying of meat products to lower its average unit price. It plans to spend ₱1 billion on capex to expand its cold chain infrastructure by building small- and medium-sized cold storage facilities in “underserved” locations, particularly in the provinces. It will use approximately ₱0.5 billion to expand its product lines. I like that “debt repayment” is not a huge component of this transaction, which is unusual considering the capex-heavy nature of NSTAR’s cold chain business.
>  - **Leftover authorized capital:** One interesting bit that I saw was that, in contemplation of the IPO, the directors of NSTAR voted to increase the company’s authorized capital stock to 2.5 billion shares. After the IPO is complete, there will be 1.8 billion shares outstanding, meaning that there will still be approximately 0.7 billion shares of unused authorized capital stock that NSTAR could use for another round of fundraising. That’s an inventory of “sellable stock” that is nearly twice the size of its IPO firm offer. As we’ve discussed with Solar Philippines NEC [SPNEC 1.97 ▲2.07%], the PSE rules demand there to be a 180-day grace period between the company’s IPO and any kind of subsequent equity raise, like a follow-on offering, stock rights offering, or private placement, so there’s no concern of any kind of immediate move, but potential investors just need to be aware of these kinds of situations.
>  - ***MB:*** *This is an intriguing offering. NSTAR’s vision is to become the “cold chain infrastructure backbone of the country”, which is an audacious vision, but visions are supposed to be big and almost hilarious-sounding. They have a large network of cold storage space, but almost all of it is for private use: this doesn’t appear to be a build-out plan that will help the agriculture industry directly through building cold storages in the provinces. The build-out plan helps NSTAR by increasing storage capacity, decreasing fuel overhead by optimizing “truck miles”, and otherwise growing its footprint to better overlap with SM, its primary patron. I know some people will probably consider NSTAR’s reliance on SM as its primary customer to be a point of risk, and that’s true; what happens to NSTAR if SM decides to “take its talents” elsewhere? At the same time, the relationship that NSTAR has forged with SM is over 20 years old, and there’s great value and efficiency in having one or two large customers that pay well and pay on time, as opposed to chasing several hundred smaller clients for payments. Some might also point out that NSTAR’s business type is that of simple cold chain logistics: they aren’t doing anything especially challenging from a quality perspective, like pharma/vaccines, or challenging from a process perspective, like fast food. And while that’s true, the “logistics” space is vast and encompasses so much. Even logistics’ sub-category, cold chain, can mean anything from refrigerated delivery trucks to multi-hectare automated cold storages with multiple climate zones and on-site processing capabilities. Our logistics and cold storage industries are still in their relative infancies, so there is a lot of room for everyone to grow. Will NSTAR be the cold chain backbone of the country because of this IPO? Hard to say! But longtime MB readers will know that logistics and cold storages are part of my long-term thesis about the growth of the middle class in this country, so this, as they say, is “relevant to my interests”. That doesn’t automatically make it a good opportunity; of course individual due diligence is required. But this is our first shot at a dedicated cold chain logistics provider on the PSE, and I’m all about it.*

>- **[FY21]     Monde Nissin [MONDE 13.50 ▲0.60%] releases earnings teaser headlining 2% revenue growth; uh-oh...** The behemoth snack manufacturer released a [teaser press release](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=a0e5a4fa7a54df8f3470cea4b051ca8f) about the company’s Q4/21 and full-year financials, with a headline pumping MONDE’s record ₱69.3 billion in revenue. You know you’re in for some spice when a company doesn’t lead with net income, or even some curated internal metric, like core net income. Even calling the ₱69.3 billion a “record” is a little misleading; when I read that, I’m thinking that they’ve blown the previous record out of the water, but here, the beat was only by 2%. After that, everything kind of goes bad. Full-year net income was down 60.5%, which MONDE blames on “one-off items” like the Arran convertible note and the IPO itself. Even baking in the lower effective tax rate gifted to MONDE by the CREATE Law,  and excluding those “one-off” items, “core net income” was down 5.4% to ₱8.2 billion. Core EBITDA was down 15.2%, which MONDE attributes to high inflation and “brand-building activities”.
>    - ***MB:*** *I can get behind looking past one-off charges related to the Arran note and the IPO, since those are not necessarily related to MONDE’s core business(es). But it gets less inspiring to see core net income falling more than 5% during a year that should have been part of a “COVID recovery” narrative. Domestic growth was fairly flat, but its Asia Pacific segment had a 21.5% net sales increase. Unfortunately, though, it appears as though inflation and higher oil prices will hit MONDE’s bottom-line. Gross profit fell 6.5%, gross margins were down 3.3%. MONDE’s margins are still healthy, but it’s worth watching and keeping in mind as global commodity prices continue to be insane. I’m also interested to see how MONDE”s naming of Drew Barrymore as Quorn US’s “Chief Mom Officer” has impacted sales in that region. I’d love to know more about how much this kind of promotional deal will cost MONDE, and what return shareholders should expect as a result of it. I like the angle of going after the habitual “home kitchen” market, as opposed to the “cool kids” market, but I’d like to know more about how efficient this brand ambassador approach will end up being. It takes money to make money, but obviously it’s better if it takes a little less to make a little more!*

>- **[UPDATE]     Raslag plummets below IPO offer price...** Raslag [ASLAG 1.89 ▼7.80%] [[link](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ASLAG:PM)], the PSE’s latest solar power generation company, saw its stock price plummet almost 8% yesterday to ₱1.89/share, 5.5% below its IPO offer price of ₱2.00/share. ASLAG briefly traded up about 5% in the first hour of trading before melting down on heavy volume to a low of ₱1.86/share. The stock marginally recovered, and then traded sideways between ₱1.88 and ₱1.95/share before finishing the day at ₱1.89. Trade volume was a lot lighter yesterday than on IPO day, with 105 million shares trading hands (as opposed to the 258 million that traded hands on Monday).
>    - ***MB:*** *Looks like my view that, in the world of solar-related IPOs, ASLAG would be more like Citicore Energy REIT [CREIT 2.51 unch] than Solar Philippines NEC [SPNEC 1.65 ▲5.10%] was accurate in that ASLAG is acting much “heavier” than SPNEC did, but I didn’t foresee the weight of the selling pressure to push through the IPO price into negative territory on the second day of trading. I’ve heard from a few Barkadans asking where the Stabilization Agent, China Bank Securities (CBS), is in all this, but the reality is that a stabilization fund is only permitted to act on sales below the IPO offer price, and even then, its activity is not guaranteed to prevent the price from going lower. The fund is meant to “prevent/minimize reduction in market price”, but the fund’s size (₱105 million) and life-span (30 days) are limited. The Stabilization Agent, the bank that operates the Stabilization Fund, is not compelled to exhaust the Stabilization Fund on any attempted sales below the IPO price until all of the fund is exhausted; it’s more of an art, and different banks acting as the Stabilization Agent might react to the same conditions in different ways. Perhaps, like with what happened during AREIT’s [AREIT 39.95 ▲0.38%] IPO, the selling pressure is just too strong, and the Stabilization Agent has determined (for now) to conserve its ammunition for a period when the funds can be used to snipe a thinner ladder of asking prices. Theoretically, if CBS had deployed the Stabilization Fund as though it were a robot that operated under the simple command of “IF(current_price < IPO_price, BUY(lowest_ask))”, then CBS would have depleted the entire ₱105 million fund before lunch yesterday, and the stock would be completely exposed to the potentially harsh life of price discovery that can happen when an IPO stock slips below the offer price. I know there are probably some ASLAG bagholders out there that wish CBS would have been more aggressive, and I feel your pain. I felt the same way when AREIT slipped beneath the waves. But it’s a good reminder that a Stabilization Fund is only a help, not a guarantee, and if the market turns against a stock with conviction there is very little any Stabilization Agent can do to prevent nature from running its course.*

>- **[UPDATE]     North Star Meat Merchants defers IPO because of “market volatility”...** North Star Meat Merchants [NSTAR 10.00 pre-IPO] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=9c144f62f145ed013470cea4b051ca8f)] announced yesterday that it was deferring its IPO which had just been scheduled for June 24, just a day before NSTAR would have been expected to disclose the final price for the IPO offer period. NSTAR’s deferral disclosure to the PSE did not say that NSTAR was canceling the process, only that it was being deferred, “due to increased market volatility amidst inflationary concerns”, despite also reporting that the reception to its offer during the book-building process was “positive”. The company also said that it plans to proceed with its expansion plans “with an adjusted timetable and funding source”, and hopes to “tap the capital markets in the future.”
>    - ***MB:*** *The underwriters for this offering, BDO Capital [BDO 128.30 ▼0.54%] and China Bank Capital [CHIB 26.80 ▼0.56%], have both been calling around to clients and contacts to gauge potential interest in order to set the appropriate IPO offer price. If their estimated clearing price was too low, as it appears may have been the case here, and NSTAR’s owner Anthony Ng has other potential options to fund his plans, as also appears to be the case here, then it makes some sense to defer the IPO if doing so doesn’t harm NSTAR’s expansion plans, and NSTAR thinks that institutional investors will be more risk tolerant after inflation peaks or we get a better understanding of where this inflation wave is taking us. If Mr. Ng can keep the growth going with debt or other forms of financing for now and wait out this “inflation storm”, then all the time and money spent prepping NSTAR for market will not be wasted as he would be able to reinitialize the process with minimal updates required. This is the second deal to crumble this week due to concerns about what inflation might do to the market. The Ayala Group killed the massive AC Energy [ACEN 7.49 ▲2.46%] swap with ACE Enexor [ACEX 9.61 ▼7.24%] for the same reason. How will the fear of rising inflation impact the VistaREIT [VREIT 1.75] IPO, or the fetal IPOs of Balai Ni Fruitas [BALAI pre-IPO] and Upson International Corp [OCTGN pre-SEC]? As I mentioned on Twitter, it feels like everyone is pulling their boats into harbor. How bad will this storm be?*

>- **[Q&A]     What is an “IPO by way of introduction”?...** I got a few of these questions after Abacore [ABA 1.52 ▲4.11%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=d0a914b2bb8419fb3470cea4b051ca8f)] announced its plan to issue a stock dividend of shares of its subsidiary, Philippine Regional Investment Development Corp. (PRIDE), to ABA shareholders, and eventually list PRIDE on the PSE using a method called “IPO by way of introduction”. Let’s just get the easy stuff out of the way first. Both a “normal” IPO (Normal IPO) and an IPO by way of introduction (Intro IPO) end up in the same place, that is, with a percentage of a new company’s shares listed on the PSE for active trading. The differences come in everything that happens before (and after) the shares go live for trading. In a Normal IPO, the underwriter will work with the company or the sponsor to put together a prospectus, figure out the right price to sell the shares at, sell the shares, and then list the shares for active trading. There’s a lot of information that needs to be disclosed in this process, because it’s a new company and all the participants need to have access to the same information to make informed decisions about whether to invest. In an Intro IPO, the shares that will be listed are either already listed on another stock exchange, or (as is happening here), will be distributed to shareholders by way of a property dividend by a company that is already listed on the PSE; in either case, the assumption is that there’s enough public information out there already on the shares to do away with that whole price-discovery exercise and disclosure requirement. When the shares are distributed by a property dividend, the initial value of the IPO shares is supported by a fairness opinion, instead of the whole book-building process that an underwriter would undertake in a Normal IPO. Once approved by the PSE, the shares are listed, but the fun is only beginning. Now is where it gets weird. Unlike Normal IPOs, which begin their trading life subject to the 50% price increase ceiling and 30% price decrease floor, Intro IPOs are born onto the market with absolutely no limits of any kind, setting up a potentially wild first day of trading
>    - ***MB:*** *The last time we had a stock list in this way was with Altus Property Ventures [APVI 16.20 ▲5.19%] back in the middle of 2020. The fairness opinion set APVI’s price at ₱10.10/share, and when trading started, the first trade was made at ₱40.00/share and triggered a 10-minute trading pause. When trading resumed, the price shot up to over ₱241.00/share in the first 30 minutes of trading. That’s around a 2,280% increase. Absolutely insane. Yet, within the hour, the stock was trading at around ₱100.00/share, which was a huge gain from ₱10.10, but also a massive loss from ₱241. By lunch it was trading at around ₱30/share. It closed the day at ₱18.50. That’s still up 83% from the fairness opinion level, but down 93% from the intra-day high. It was a weird day. I’m a big fan of spin-offs, and I like the method of listing a company directly this way through a dividend, but I’m not a big fan of the PSE’s weird blindspot toward the price action of these IPOs. By not applying any restrictions, the PSE silently endorses the use of these stocks for manipulation and speculation. Why not apply the standard ceiling and floor limits off of the fairness opinion price? Why pretend, just for IPOs like this, that there’s no price precedent that could be applied to prevent this kind of wild price action? Anyway, if you want to read my live-blog format of the APVI IPO, you can do that [here](https://mailchi.mp/ef07a9b5bb6b/altus-property-up-83-on-first-day-of-trading-but-down-92-from-10am-peak?e=933945058a). Otherwise, crack your knuckles and get ready for PRIDE, because it’s probably not going to be a quiet little thing.*

>    - **Cebu Landmasters** [CLI 2.69 ▲1.51%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=12a2a5ded05d6ac63470cea4b051ca8f)] guides that it may set “performance records” in 2022 based on quick project turnarounds and smooth construction progress of 21 projects. CLI’s CEO reiterated the company’s goal of achieving 20% growth for 2022, and projected that CLI would set new sales records in 2022 during the shareholder meeting on Monday. While the company keeps growing, the stock is still down from 45% from its 2021 all-time highs in the ₱4.00/share range. When will this outperformance show up on the chart?
>    - **Inflation** [[link](https://www.rappler.com/business/inflation-rate-philippines-may-2022/)] rose to 5.4% in May, and the government has revised its estimated range upward for the average inflation rate in 2022 to “3.7%-4.7%”. In response, the BSP has signalled its interest in two rate increases to get the interest rate up to 2.75% by August. There is no relief in sight.
>    - **The IATF** [[link](https://www.manilatimes.net/2022/06/08/news/national/govt-allows-100-capacity-for-shops-under-alert-level-1/1846565)] said that it will allow shops to operate at 100% under Alert Level 1, but “subject to presentation of proof of full vaccination before participating in mass gatherings or entry into indoor establishments”. Great for malls and restaurants.

>- **[NEWS]     PXP Energy to pivot after DoE suspends work on SC75 and SC72...** PXP Energy [PXP 4.74 unch] [[link](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/04/28/pxp-energy-to-pursue-otheroil-gas-exploration-projects/)], the petroleum exploration firm controlled by Manny V. Pangilinan, disclosed that it will pivot its exploration and development efforts to other service contracts (SCs) that it has interests in, after revealing that the Department of Energy (DoE) has told PXP to “indefinitely suspend” exploration activities related to SC 75 and SC 72. PXP said that it will comply with the DoE direction, but will continue its exploration activities in other SCs, namely, SC 40 and SC 74.
>    - ***MB:*** *Both of the SCs that PXP must stop work on are located to the west of Palawan, in areas that are at the heart of the border/sovereignty conflict between the Philippines and China. While the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding in 2018 to establish a foundation for the joint exploration of the West Philippine Sea (or South China Sea, depending on your “perspective”), a grand total of zero projects have grown up out of the soil of that agreement. Analysts believe that the recent stop-work orders from the DoE, which have resulted in PXP shifting its focus to SCs in Visayas, are the result of pressure from China. One [article](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/philippines-southchinasea-04212022134327.html) referred to this pressure as “coercion”. This is purely a political development, and as such, investors should not expect there to be much change in the government’s approach ahead of the national election to select a new president. Will the next president continue to do as China asks hoping for infrastructure handouts, or will they adopt a more antagonistic and defiant stance? As the last election cycle demonstrated, you can’t take a candidate’s words at face-value; you have to wait to see how the president-elect behaves to get a feeling for how these SCs in the West Philippine Sea will be impacted.*

>- **[FY21]     Philippine Stock Exchange comprehensive income up 26% on listing and transaction fees...** The Philippine Stock Exchange [PSE 208.00 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=d5201e891e437c753470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed its audited financial statements for FY21, and revealed robust performance across nearly all product lines leading to a 26% increase in comprehensive income. The PSE generated ₱0.5 billion in listing fees in 2021 (up 30% y/y), which is the amount that the PSE charges companies to “list” shares for trade after conducting an IPO, SRO, FOO, or similar equity raising event. Transaction fees were ₱183 million in 2021 (up 13% y/y), and fees related to block sales doubled to ₱40 million. The PSE said that it is [set to launch](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/04/28/pse-income-hits-new-record-as-more-local-firms-go-public/) its “data analytics platform”, and roll-out new versions of the PSE EASy program and the PSE Academy “in the coming months’.
>    - ***MB:*** *With listing fees having such a huge impact on the PSE’s profitability, it’s crazy that our stock exchange is in the state that it is. If the PSE were a normal profit-seeking company, we’d expect it to rabidly pursue new listings through IPOs, and to make it easier for firms to conduct stock rights offerings and follow-on offerings. We’d expect it to be aggressive and unrelenting with brokers to improve and modernize the stock trading experience up to present-day standards. We’d expect it to do everything in its power to make it easier to do business with the PSE, whether as a company looking to raise money, or as the average salary worker looking for a way to beat inflation on their savings. Yes, it’s true that the PSE had a great 2021 compared to its 2020 and 2019, but the truth is that the modest uptick in listings is only the first step. The modest uptick in volume is just a start. The increased access to the markets through PSE EASy is a welcome development, but one that is only the cement floor of the full house that still needs to be built there. I applaud the changes that the PSE has made, and the increased effort it seems to be making to grow its reach and relevance, but anyone who trades the exchange even passively knows that there’s a lot more work that needs to be done. In this way, the PSE’s success is the market’s success, and I hope that the PSE uses 2021 as an inspiration to push for far-greater levels of success.*

#The PSE lost 229 points (!!) to 6530 ▼3.4%

So last week ended with a real **wet fart of a trading session**. It's hard to find any traders now that aren't talking about inflation, or the BSP's signal that there will be ""four or five"" rate increases in 2022. It didn't help that the US markets dumped on fears that US inflation data would be worse, and those fears were largely founded: the US inflation rate ""defied expectations"" by posting a 40-year high and being worse than was hoped.

>- **[NEWS] The PSE moves to a “floorless trading” setup...** The Philippine Stock Exchange [PSE 191.40 ▼4.30%] [[link](https://www1.pse.com.ph/resource/memos/2022/TPA_2022-00031.pdf)] announced on Friday that its board of directors would shift to a “floorless” trading set-up, The PSE points to the “shift to digitalization and automation”, which has pushed many brokers to conduct their trading activities off the PSE trading floor, in separate off-site facilities. The PSE said that these developments were “driven partly by the pandemic” and the “continuous evolution of trading operations in global markets”. The move to a floorless trading set-up will be permanent, but will only take effect once the small number of brokers that still maintain on-site trading booths complete their pull-out initiatives and start trading operations.
> - ***MB:*** *The press release definitely had that “skeleton crew in the office on a Friday” vibe to it, as evidenced by the uncharacteristic number of grammatical errors in the first paragraph. Looking beyond the form of the release to its content, there really isn’t much here that will impact the average retail trader. For those (like me) who love the markets, and have always dreamed of the opportunity to see live trading occur in the cliche trading floor style, this announcement is bitter-sweet. On the one hand, I appreciate the market’s willingness to move away from the obsolete trading methods of the past and fully embrace the electronic dominance of modern stock trading. On the other hand, I’m kind of mad at myself for not taking the time to try and see the live trading happen in person before the pandemic effectively killed the practice. The pre-IPO bell ringing ceremonies might be all we have left, but even those have become so sterile and awkward as everyone stands in attention like plastic dolls in PPE in adherence with COVID protocols. Now that COVID protocols are much less severe, my hope is that the floor can be opened up for IPOs to allow confirmed IPO buyers the chance to come in to see the bell-ringing ceremony. Might even be a great opportunity for the IPO company to cater an event to give back to the retail shareholders that put their hard-earned pesos into the IPO offer. Just thinking out loud. I don’t expect that to happen, but it would be a lot more fun than just watching masked suits ring the bell on Zoom.*

>- **[NEWS] 8990 Holdings buys Cebu-based mid-market developer for ₱88 million...** 8990 Holdings [HOUSE 10.48 ▲0.77%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=51cf426d0b3a77fe3470cea4b051ca8f)] revealed that it had entered into an investment agreement with several shareholders to acquire 68% of the common shares of Piccadilly Premier Land (PPL), a Cebu-based mid-market affordable home developer. HOUSE said the transaction will “broaden its reach” through PPL’s existing portfolio of “affordable-priced projects”. HOUSE will pay for its shares in cash once some parcels of land have been transferred into PPL and HOUSE has completed its due diligence.
> - ***MB:*** *I like to see it when companies acquire companies, projects, or assets that exist outside of their immediate ecosystem. That said, I don’t know anything about PPL or the shareholders involved, so there could be greater overlap on this deal than is apparent right now. One thing that is worth noting here is that this is a share purchase, not an asset purchase. In an asset purchase, a company buys a “thing”, and when it buys that thing, the thing comes with a very limited set of potential problems that are usually well-documented. In a share purchase, a company buys a slice of the legal entity that owns all the assets, and also all the liabilities. The set of potential problems is no longer limited at all; purchasers have to think about existing liabilities as well as potential liabilities, and this is where due diligence becomes crucially important. Are there current legal problems or even the potential for legal problems? Are there issues with BIR, DOLE, or Customs? Are there any potential liabilities for environmental issues? Is the company exposed to any potential contractual disputes with vendors and clients? This “opening of the kimono” by PPL, where it bares all of its books to HOUSE, can be a tense process. It’s probably why there are far fewer arms-length deals done in the Philippines as compared to more developed markets. Fingers crossed that everything goes well, because if this is an arms-length deal, I’d love to see more like this.*

PORT achieved this by having a director resign (his ownership stake is now considered “public”), and by selling 335,000 common shares to a single common shareholder. It’s a weird set of moves, but it got the job done. PORT avoided automatic delisting, but the stock is still suspended for failure to execute its basic reporting responsibilities to shareholders.
> - **CTS Global** [CTS 0.90 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=e5046310768f8cbc3470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed that it disbursed ₱230 million on “Scaling of Global Trading Operations”, which is a little bit less than the ₱261 million that CTS spent on the same thing the previous month. In this context, “scaling of global trading operations” just means that CTS is pushing this money into the hands of its traders to buy and sell shares on international markets. Can’t wait to see how this injection is working when CTS reports its Q2 earnings in a few months.
> - **Semirara Mining and Power** [SCC 34.10 ▼4.48%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=873ad17157786c933470cea4b051ca8f)] President and COO, Maria Cristina Gotianun, sold 302,792 shares of SCC for ₱10,843,741. There are a lot of investors that follow the Gotianuns in and out of SCC, but I don’t track SCC that closely, so I’m not sure what those traders might think about this.
> - **Manila Water** [MWC 17.60 ▼1.35%] [[link](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/06/13/manila-water-targets-deals-to-expand-presence-in-phl/)] Chief Administrative Officer said that the company hopes to “swing” at least one local deal before the end of2022 to expand MWC’s presence in the Philippines. The CAO also said that MWC’s deal pipeline is “healthy”, with potential deals that are both “greenfield” (not started construction) and “brownfield” (where there are already constructed or even operating assets). MWC to make as much PH-based hay as it can while Enrique Razon’s sun is shining?

>- **[IPO]     ORCA Cold Chain Solutions files for ₱1.5 billion November IPO...** 
>    - **➤ The deal:** One of the country’s few high-tech cold storage service providers, ORCA Cold Chain Solutions [ORCA 0.88 pre-SEC] [[link](https://orcacoldchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ORCA-Cold-Chain-Solutions-IPO-Prospectus.pdf)], is planning a November IPO to raise ₱1.5 billion at a maximum price of ₱0.88/share. ORCA has chosen ICCP to be its sole issue manager, and one of its two joint lead underwriters. There’s a stabilization fund, but no stabilization agent has been chosen yet. 
>    - **➤ The company:** ORCA is owned by the Cosiquien Family, and has two locations (one in Taguig City, its flagship, and the other in Caloocan City) with a combined 35,000 pallet positions of capacity. ORCA’s differentiator is that it uses an automated picker system to pull pallets and manage inventory. This gives ORCA the ability to build vertically and maintain a smaller real estate footprint.
>    - **➤ Primary/secondary:** Including the over-allotment option, the deal is approximately 61% primary, and 39% secondary. “Primary” means that these are new shares that ORCA will create and sell, and the money raised from the sale of these shares will go towards building and running ORCA. “Secondary” means that these are existing shares that are already owned by a person (in this case, holding companies owned by Michael Cosiquien), and the money raised from the sale of these shares will go directly to the people who are selling (Mr. Cosiquien). Out of the ₱1.5 billion that will be raised at this valuation, ORCA will have access to ₱0.9 billion in gross proceeds.
>    - **➤ Use of proceeds:** After listing fees and associated costs are deducted, ORCA expects to have approximately ₱841 million in proceeds that it will spend on working capital (35%), development of a new location in Cebu province (20%), expansion of its Taguig location (18%), development of a new location in Cagayan de Oro (14%), and the remaining 13% on “new business initiatives” to “expand its existing capabilities” and “develop new competencies”.
>    - **➤ The business:** ORCA’s revenues have been growing at a brisk pace: it took in ₱3 million in 2018, ₱100 million in 2019, ₱294 million in 2020, and ₱340 million in 2021. Unfortunately, the company still operates at a net loss. ORCA’s net loss in 2020 was ₱356 million, which ORCA has trimmed somewhat to a net loss of ₱312 million in 2021. No data was provided for the first half of 2022, but it looks like ORCA and ICCP plan to update this portion of the prospectus when we get closer to setting a final price for this offering.
>    - ***MB:*** *Long-time readers will know that I’ve been (not so) patiently waiting for some of the private cold storage and logistics firms to tap the market and make a move, but those with a keen eye will see that this is not that kind of situation. This is a small raise, with proceeds mostly going towards working capital. From an industry perspective, even when all the new facilities are operational, it only makes ORCA a mid-pack provider in terms of size, network reach, and capability. Yes, the growth story is there, as ORCA will use portions of the proceeds to juice construction and development of two new locations in Cebu and CDO, but it’s not clear what advantage this kind of growth will bring to ORCA or its shareholders. Are the customers that ORCA has under contract in Taguig prepared to anchor a majority of the pallet positions in those new locations? The ability to build vertically and rely on tech to organize and pick pallets is tantalizing in terms of land-use maximization and efficiency, but what conclusions can we draw from ORCA’s financials to date? Are they an indictment of the approach, or of its execution? I think that the 2022 financials will answer a lot of these questions. I’m hopeful. But this feels like the appetizer to a main course that we still haven’t had the chance to hear about yet.*

>- **[NEWS]     Monde Nissin rocked by European recall of “Lucky Me” instant noodles...** Monde Nissin [MONDE 13.04 ▼2.40%] [[link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-08/monde-nissin-extends-fall-as-philippines-probes-lucky-me)], the food manufacturer owned by Betty Ang and her husband, Hoediono Kweefanus, was blind-sided by a public recall of its “Lucky Me” instant noodle product after Taiwan, France, Ireland and Malta, all issued recall notices for variants of the Lucky Me line of products for elevated presence of ethylene oxide, a pesticide used on herbs and spices. MONDE responded to the recall notice by reassuring consumers that it satisfies the ethylene oxide rules for the Philippines and the US, and that MONDE itself didn’t add the pesticide to the product, though the pesticide may have been in some of the ingredients used in the manufacture of Lucky Me in other countries. he authorities in Ireland tested a batch of Lucky Me that was produced in Thailand, but no information was available for the source of the Lucky Me products that failed inspection in Taiwan, France, and Malta. Our own Food and Drug Administration said that MONDE uses a local manufacturer for the ingredients, and so our packets of Lucky Me are not impacted by this recall. The FDA is investigating the recall.
>    - ***MB:*** *The stock is down about 7% from the time the news first broke, which came after a 4-day, 13% rally in MONDE’s price from ₱12.70 to ₱14.40, which itself has come after an 8-month, 39% drop in the price from the highs of September when it was briefly trading above ₱20.50/share. All this is to say that the roller-coaster ride that is MONDE’s price action is unreasonably wild and entertaining for what really should be a boring and uninteresting story. I get why MONDE would underline its compliance with Philippine and US law in its press release (these are massive markets for MONDE), but their focus on those markets seemed to imply that MONDE was less concerned with its compliance to the offended markets’ health regulations. I also get why MONDE would make a big deal out of noting that it doesn’t purposefully add the pesticide to its products, but it’s hardly reassuring for the company to sketch out a scenario where these harmful chemicals might just end up in MONDE products because some upstream supplier used them on some ingredient. Does MONDE only test ingredients of products intended for sale in the PH and US for these pesticides? If they test all ingredients for this pesticide, what caused their tests to miss these batches? I have no doubt that inflation has caused almost every food manufacturer to scroll a couple of pages deeper into their purchasing contacts for certain ingredients due to price and logistics concerns, but with food, you just can’t cut corners. I’m not saying that MONDE cut a corner here, but I am saying that the statement from MONDE doesn’t do enough to address the problem to make this feel like a low-probability fluke or one-off.*

After having the case dismissed, the prosecutor has filed for a Motion to Reconsider. MWIDE said that it would continue to file the appropriate pleadings to see this issue through. The grounds of the original dismissal were substantial (that the law doesn’t deem the alleged actions as illegal anymore), so it’s hard to think what the prosecutor might be doing in this case except for exhausting all of the prosecution’s legal options.

This is part of CNPF’s “double down” on plant-based meat alternatives. The line has only been active for two months, and is already in over 500 retail outlets. CNPF considers the “seafood alternatives” category to be a “wide open space”. I’m curious to try it, and curious why they didn’t call it “unFISH” to match the other protein types in its portfolio, like unMEAT and unCHEESE.

Basically, ACEN wants to cover its butt just in case it decides to not go forward with the project; it doesn’t want to be seen as misleading investors into thinking that this project was a certified slam-dunk, hundy-p guarantee. Responsible messaging from ACEN.

ORCA’s differentiator is that it uses an automated picker system to pull pallets and manage inventory. This gives ORCA the ability to build vertically and maintain a smaller real estate footprint.

Thanks to **Pam Aquino** for the meme appreciation, and to **qwerty123** for the question about stabilization funds (more on that below). Thanks also to /u/StefanJanobski for spotting the error in yesterday's note about the Air21 acquisition, where I incorrectly attributed **AyalaLand Logistics** with the buy when really it was **AC Logistics**. Thanks all!

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]      VistaREIT IPO doesn’t look over-subscribed...** According to my unofficial tracking of the VistaREIT [VREIT 1.75 pre-IPO] IPO offer period, only a small handful of readers have reported receiving a fractional allocation of VREIT IPO shares. The poll recorded responses from 88 readers, who requested an aggregate of ₱12.7 million in VREIT IPO shares, and who received an aggregate of ₱12.0 million. That’s a 94% allocation rate. All reported PSE EASy requests were allocated in full. The only two brokers that appeared to struggle with allocations were Abacus Securities (75% allocation rate) and First Metro Securities (94% allocation rate). Even brokers that usually sell-out of shares as a matter of tradition, like COL Financial [COL 3.56 ▲0.56%], managed to maintain a 100% allocation rate from the responses provided.
>    - ***MB:*** *Based on this information, it looks like VREIT will start trading on Wednesday next week having conducted a successful IPO offer, but without the hype/buzz of being over-subscribed. Keep in mind, the information that I’m working with is all self-reported, and I do not undertake to verify each of the claims provided. I can’t say how representative my sample is of the larger market as a whole, but with 89 responses and several from each of the major brokerages at varying levels of request, I think it’s pretty safe to say that VREIT will not be oversubscribed with respect to the broker or PSE EASy buckets/tranches of IPO stock. That leaves the institutional bucket/tranche, which is sold by the underwriters to foreign and domestic funds, government agencies, and private/wealthy clients. Usually, the price of the offer is based on the interest in this tranche, which makes sense, because this tranche usually makes up the largest portion of an IPO stock’s total offering (70%). Unfortunately, ever since that Haus Talk [HTI 1.03 ▲1.98%] [thing](https://mailchi.mp/ad602040a146/haus-talk-clarifies-strong-demand-not-yet-oversubscribed?e=933945058a), we haven’t heard very much from the IPOing company or its underwriter(s) about the status of the institutional tranche in the days before the IPO. My assumption is that the institutional shares will all get sold, but that we aren’t looking at a notable over-subscription for that bucket/tranche either.*

>- **[Q&A]     How can the stab fund agent be buying and selling at the same time?...** I had a few Barkadans ask this question yesterday, in reference to the disclosure by Raslag [ASLAG 1.92 ▼4.95%] that its Stabilization Fund Agent, China Bank Securities (CBS), bought just over 6 million shares of ASLAG on Tuesday when ASLAG’s price dropped significantly below its IPO offer price of ₱2.00/share. Each question pointed out that, on that day, CBS was also credited with being the selling broker for over 40 million shares of ASLAG; how could CBS sell ASLAG shares harder than it purchased them, when CBS was supposedly the stabilization agent for the stock? The answer is (probably) that those sales attributed to CBS are from CBS’s role as a broker to its clients. When private clients of CBS, COL Financial, FMSec, or any of the other brokers execute a personal/private order, those orders are routed through the system and are attributed (as a buy or sell order) to the broker that facilitated the trade. CBS wouldn’t be trading its “own book” (that is, making trades on ASLAG for itself) against ASLAG while under contract to perform stabilization agent duties for ASLAG’s offering; the sell trades attributed to CBS on that day would have been the personal/private trades of CBS clients, which CBS is obligated to execute.
>    - ***MB:*** *Stabilization funds have been a hot topic of conversation ever since Medilines Distributors [MEDIC 0.69 unch] boldly dropped off into the abyss without one last year, but that conversation has not always been as useful as it could have been. As many have pointed out, while the presence or absence of a stabilization fund is documented in the prospectus and filing disclosures, the “plain language” about what a stabilization fund actually is, what it can do, and what it cannot do, is not. I think the rush to latch on to stab funds grows out of the PSE’s interest in attracting new investors to the market. IPOs are one of the big casino-like events that get a lot of media traction, and stabilization funds make rugpull results like what happened with MEDIC less likely to harm the PSE’s image to new investors through negative word-of-mouth. I realize that this rant is off-track, but the larger point that I’m trying to make is that, like a lot of things in life, the “how it actually works” is a lot more nuanced and difficult to understand completely than the high-level “how it seems to work” summary. I’m going to dig much deeper into this next week, with a one-day special episode to explain as much as I know about stability funds, in plain language, that I can refer back to in the future.*

>- **[CORRECTION]     AC Logistics acquired a majority stake in Air21, not AyalaLand Logistics...** Yesterday, in the NOTES section, I said that the Philippine Competition Commission approved AyalaLand Logistics’s purchase of Air21, but this is not accurate. AC Logistics is the Ayala Group entity that bought Air21. While ALLHC and AC Logistics can be considered “sister” companies (as they have the same ultimate parent company, Ayala Corp [AC 671.00 ▼3.31%]), they have different immediate parent companies and, at the end of the day, are very different companies. Thank you to /u/StefanJanobski for spotting the error. Sorry for the error and any confusion that it might have caused.

>- **[NOTES]     Quick from around the market...**

>    - **BSP** [[link](https://mb.com.ph/2022/06/09/3-policy-rate-possible-bsp/)] board member, Felipe M. Medalla, the incoming BSP Governor, thinks that 4 rate hikes this year is possible. Mr. Medalla said that a 3% interest rate is possible if it is needed to curb inflation, but that that decision will ""depend on the data"".
>    - **Raslag** [ASLAG 1.92 ▼4.95%] [[link](https://www1.pse.com.ph/stockMarket/companyInfo.html?id=694&security=689&tab=0)] closed in the negative again, with heavy selling pressure for any prices above the IPO offer price. Volume was about half of what it was the day before. The patient is in stable condition, but the vitals aren’t robust enough yet to let the nurses take a break.
>    - **Filinvest Land** [FLI 0.94 ▲1.08%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=18b7a8e811d1141f3470cea4b051ca8f)] receives SEC approval for the sale of ₱11.9 billion in bonds out of its ₱30 billion shelf-registration. This sale will consume the remainder of that shelf-registration, which was approved in 2020. There will be 3- year Bonds Due 2025 with interest rate of 5.3455% and 5-year Bonds Due 2027 with interest rate of 6.4146%.
>    - **Leisure & Resorts World** [LR 1.37 ▲3.01%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=095f2190db567d223470cea4b051ca8f)] has changed its external auditor from SGV to PWC. LR cites “Cost efficiency and other business reasons” for the change, but could it have something to do with LR ending up as a member of the Late Filing Friends? LR wasn’t suspended, and didn’t outwardly blame its auditor for the delay in its financial statements, but good on LR for making a change if something wasn’t working right in that relationship.

#The PSE gained 42 points to 5896 ▲0.7%

Hold on to your butts.

The **Consumer Price Index** (CPI) report came out overnight in the US. Overall, the ""velocity"" of the price increase in September was falling relative to the July/August record peak, but the data showed that prices had increased more than the market expected. 

It was a mixed-bag result that produced a... bonkers reaction in the market. The US markets opened down 500 points, with some analysts calling the CPI data ""disgusting"" and a ""guarantee"" of a 100 basis point interest rate hike, but 3 hours later, at the time of this writing (2AM Manila time), the markets completely reversed and are now up over 750 points. That's a 1250 point swing on the day so far.

>- **[NOTES] Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **US Consumer Price Index** (CPI) [[link](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/12/stock-futures-are-up-as-investors-await-inflation-data.html)] data for September came out overnight, and showed that prices in September were up 8.2% y/y, relative to September 2021, but that this increase was less than the 9.1% y/y increase in June and the 8.3% y/y increase in August. The rate of inflation in the US was drifting lower, but it was not falling as quickly as some would like. Initially, the US markets consumed this news to be very negative, and the DOW was down more than 500 points just after the opening bell. Yet, within 3 hours, the DOW was up almost 700 points and commentators were talking about how the US might be at or near the peak of the inflation. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *It was a wild day of volatility for anyone that trades the US markets. But it just goes to show how novel this fact pattern is for investors, traders, corporations, and governments. The same news that was met with learned helplessness and a flood of “SELL SELL SELL” orders was later looked on as a potential light at the end of the tunnel and a beacon of positive changes to come. Still, the slow rate of the decline of the rate of inflation is worrying, and has some thinking that inflation won’t be back to the high-end of the US government’s target range until Q1 of 2024.*
>    - **DITO CME** [DITO 2.55 ▲2.41%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=cc720198401a36e03470cea4b051ca8f)] took a full week to respond to allegations that it was in material breach of a contract with PLDT [TEL 1438.00 ▲1.27%], and it did so with a one-paragraph disclosure that said: “DITO Telecommunity believes that there is no material breach. It will also ensure that the company will thresh out and exhaust all available remedies.” 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *Very similar to the tone and sequence of events that transpired when BDO [BDO 118.00 ▲1.72%] accused a Udenna Corp subsidiary of being in default on an outstanding debt and of being uncommunicative and uncooperative, only to have Udenna jump back to the bargaining table and make a sudden payment to deflate the conflict. Here, TEL has accused DITO of being in breach of an outstanding debt and of being uncommunicative and uncooperative, only to have DITO jump back in to say that the issue is “currently being discussed by the parties”. I guess we’ll know soon how quickly this dispute is following the same script if suddenly the debt is paid and DITO comes out to say something to the effect of “everything’s fine, everything’s always been fine, there’s nothing to see here.” DITO’s stock is trading near its 52-week low, at levels that we haven’t seen since the months after the COVID lockdown in 2020. DITO’s stock is down 49% year-to-date, down 65% over the past 12 months, and down 86% from its 2021 “Basurapalooza” high of ₱17.94/share.*
>    - **Globe Telecom** [GLO 2170.00 ▼2.25%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=4c865ee94ab9fba23470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed that it sold 100% of its stock rights offering (SRO) shares during the first two rounds of the SRO. The SRO will list and become available for trading on October 28. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *100% take-up in the first two rounds means that neither GLO nor its underwriter needed to mop up any unwanted shares to complete the transaction, which is an indication that there was enough demand with GLO’s shareholders to absorb the SRO organically. GLO’s market price of ₱2170/share means that the GLO SRO shares still represent a 22.5% discount. Let’s see how that holds in the two weeks leading up to the listing.*
>    - **Aboitiz Power** [AP 31.80 ▲2.58%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ae8c9a41202bce113470cea4b051ca8f)] signed a joint venture agreement with Mainstream Renewable Power (MRP) to build a 90 megawatt wind farm in Libmanan, Camarines Sur. The deal will see AP buy a 60% stake in the Libmanan project, which MRP has been developing since 2017. This will be AP’s first wind project. MRP is an Australian company with satellite offices in Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines. MB Quick Take: AP stomping around the grounds like a well-fed monster. It must help reduce the potential risk of buying into projects like this when you have several members of your executive team occupying critical regulatory oversight positions in the industry. AP shareholders will be happy to see AP out there making the best of the situation to try and achieve its goal of having 4.6 GW of renewable energy in its portfolio by 2030. (4) Citystate Savings Bank [CSB 8.41 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=4173d032bb3288ae3470cea4b051ca8f)] will list an additional 50.6 million shares on October 17. These shares were sold back in 2020 by way of private placements, headlined by AMB. ALC Holdings and Management Corp., at a price of ₱10/share. This will bring CSB’s listed shares up from 100 million to 150.6 million. MB Quick Take: The shares were already considered “outstanding” for the purposes of CSB’s stock price, proportional ownership, and voting rights, so this listing won’t really change very much. This is one of the most thinly-traded stocks on the PSE. Yesterday, there was absolutely no action in this stock, and it can go weeks at a time with zero volume. When there is volume, it’s usually ₱800 to ₱2000 worth of stock changing hands. The biggest value traded in CSB since February, in a single day, was on March 31 when ₱49,368 in CSB stock changed hands. Woah, settle down!

FCG also teased a record-setting top-line sales figure of ₱2.43 billion, and declared a ₱0.01936/share cash dividend out of its unrestricted retained earnings as of June 30, 2022. FCG said that it started 2022 with 107 stores, and that it now has 142 stores, and has targeted to have 165 stores by the end of the year. MB Quick Take: FCG is one of those companies that has a non-standard fiscal year that ends on June 30th of each year. This was only a teaser press release, not the full annual report, so all we have to go on are the cherry-picked highlights that FCG wants to share. A full analysis will need to wait. But right off the top, there are a few things to note and look into further when the full report comes out. One is that FCG has built new stores at a rate of 3.6/month so far in 2022, so it is only on pace to end with 151 stores (14 shy of its goal). The other is that FCG’s dividend policy is to distribute between 10 and 30% of the previous year’s consolidated net income, and this year’s dividend of ₱90 million is more than 45% of FY22’s net income and is therefore well-above the high end of that range.

This is the third year in a row that BHI has been suspended for failing to meet the exchange’s bare minimum of reporting standards. MB Quick Take: I really dislike how casual BHI is with the tradeability of its stocks, and I am not a fan of how permissive the PSE has been in allowing BHI to drop into a suspended state as a means of getting more time to complete its annual financial statements. Completing an annual report is a thing that every company does, every single year, all over the world. It shouldn’t be something that shareholders have any doubts about whether the company will complete or not, and it certainly shouldn’t be something that a company should fail to do on three consecutive occasions. When I mentioned a few weeks back about “getting our house in order” before the GCash Crew arrives, this culture of comfort with repeat offenders of minority shareholder rights is exactly what I’m talking about.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[COMING_UP]     Monday morning look at the week ahead...** For a short week, this one is likely going to be pretty interesting. On Thursday, we’ll get the decision of the US Federal Reserve (US Fed) on the size of its November rate hike. That’s going to happen on Wednesday in the US, which will be overnight/Thursday morning for PH-based traders. Everyone expects the US Fed to raise rates for a 6th consecutive time, but will the US Fed maintain its aggressive rate hike pace, or will it soften its approach? As mentioned in previous MB episodes, BSP Governor Felipe Medalla has signaled that he’ll take considerable direction from the US Fed’s decision and is prepared to be aggressive. While the Department of Finance Secretary, Benjamin Diokno, has made headlines recently speaking out loud and out of turn on behalf of the BSP, over which the DoF has no authority, perhaps it was just some pre-Halloween cosplay on Mr. Diokno’s part. But even Mr. Diokno’s out-of-pocket remarks didn’t reveal any signs of a difference of general opinion with Mr. Medalla. Then, on Friday, we will probably get an update on the whole PLDT [TEL 1634.00 ▲0.99%] and DITO [DITO 2.95 ▲1.72%] debt situation, as that is the deadline that TEL gave for DITO to pay the ₱430 million that TEL claims to be owed in consideration for its contracted work in building out significant portions of DITO’s infrastructure. Will DITO roll over and pay in full as it did with BDO [BDO 127.30 ▲0.24%] the last time it tried this non-payment trick, or are there some post-Halloween fireworks in store for us?
>    - ***MB:*** *While the DITO thing is a point of interest, in the grand scheme of things, it’s just a lonely rock in the cold expanse of space in comparison to the US Fed decision, which is like the sun. The light from that decision will reach us fairly quickly, and it will have massive implications in terms of the perception of how much further the US Fed feels it will need to raise rates to contain inflation, how long this overall period of “transitory” inflation will last, and how well both of those things are currently priced into the markets. There are growing whispers in the US that traders there are underestimating just how high the US Fed will need to eventually raise rates (called the “terminal rate”), and that both this and the December rate raises will be taken as a cold bucket of water dumped on its premature enthusiasm for a tidy resolution.*

>- **[NOTES] Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **Eagle Cement** [EAGLE 20.75 ▲9.21%] [[link](https://www.bworldonline.com/corporate/2022/11/01/484014/eagle-cement-acquisition-seen-likely-to-go-through/)] acquisition by San Miguel [SMC 96.20 ▼2.29%] seen as likely to proceed after SMC received notice from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) that the transaction “shall not be subject to review”. The PCC did not elaborate, saying only that the implementing rules and regulations of the Philippine Competition Act did not require the PCC to review the EAGLE/SMC transaction. With no PCC review, the only hurdle left is for SMC to conduct a tender offer of EAGLE minority shares at ₱22.02/share. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *EAGLE’s steep pump on Friday pushed the price up to ₱20.75/share, which implies the market’s belief in the probability of the deal going through is about 81%. If the market thought the probability was 100%, then it would buy up shares right to the tender offer price of ₱22.02, but the fact that the price is still lower than the tender offer price suggests that there is still a perception that there’s a not insignificant chance that something might go funky.*
>    - **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas** (BSP) [[link](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/10/31/2220384/bsp-has-30-billion-more-defend-peso)] could have another US $30 billion in reserves that it could use to hold the President’s directive to defend the ₱60:$1 exchange rate level. This analysis was from ANZ Research, which noted that the BSP has already spent $12 billion in its aggressive interventions in the currency market. ANZ Research said that there is a “good chance” that the peso continues to weaken, but that the BSP has “ample capacity” to contain the devaluation from breaching the ₱60:$1 psychological level. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *As mentioned in previous MBs, the BSP is basically using US Dollars that it owns to buy Philippine Pesos on the open market, driving the price “up” for Philippine Pesos. Sort of like a stock buy-back. How useful is it for the BSP to spend $42 billion to defend an arbitrary line in the sand? Will the pressure on the Peso outlast the BSP’s willingness to throw its dollars into the currency market? There’s so much riding on the US Federal Reserve’s rate decisions in November and December.*
>    - **AyalaLand Logistics Holdings** [ALLHC 3.22 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=be375a60a1b371763470cea4b051ca8f)] 9M net income up 41% to ₱2.8 billion. ALLHC reported a 5% jump in revenues to ₱2.8 billion, headlined by ₱1.2 billion in industrial lot sales, ₱0.6 billion from commercial leasing, ₱0.5 billion from warehouse leasing (+73% y/y), and ₱0.1 billion from cold storage services (+178% y/y). 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *This is a frustrating company to analyze, largely because of the out-sized impact that industrial lot sales can have on the company’s headline profitability. I’m interested in what’s happening with ALLHC’s warehouses and cold storages, which are exploding in terms of revenue generation. If ALLHC’s warehouse services grow at the same clip through to this time next year, maybe we’ll finally see something other than dumb lot sales being the number one revenue driver for this so-called “logistics” company. And look at that cold storage growth! The numbers are still small, but there’s a ton of interest in this space in the market. DoubleDragon [DD 5.63 ▼1.57%] and Metro Pacific Investments [MPI 3.66 ▼0.54%] are rumored to be aggressively shopping all around Metro Manila for potential acquisition targets, and that’s in addition to all the regular names that are always prepared to swoop in with an offer when the time is right.*
>    - **BDO** [BDO 127.30 ▲0.24%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=9601f0ea0dd4fa0d3470cea4b051ca8f)] 9M net income up 23% to ₱40 billion, on “solid results across core businesses”. BDO’s Q3 teaser press release revealed that BDO’s gross consumer loans increased 10% y/y, and that its non-interest income rose to ₱53.2 billion on “higher fees and insurance premiums”. BDO said that its “profitability is steady and improving”, and that its “growth is broad-based and sufficiently diversified,” 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *Banks are a trailing indicator to whatever is happening on the ground with inflation and the rate hikes that have been employed to fight it. This is surely a great outcome for BDO and its shareholders, but from the conversations that I’ve had in private with bankers and property developers, it seems like there is a growing sense of something ominous on the horizon. As explained to me by someone in the retail loans industry, the higher rates have persuaded many to step away from new loans in recent weeks, putting off purchases of new cars, lots, or homes. It’s the people with existing loans who are starting to panic, as the rising rates increase the cost of monthly debt service alongside the rising costs of pretty much everything else in life, from rice to power.*

>- **[NOTES]   Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **Macay Holdings** [MACAY 4.59 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=79ab5569058b8aba3470cea4b051ca8f)] suspended by the PSE pending comprehensive disclosure on its plan to acquire RC Global Beverages (RCGB), which owns “global licensing rights to RC Cola and associated brands in over 100 countries (excluding US, Mexico and Canada)”. MACAY said that it would purchase RCGB for US $21 million in cash, plus the assumption of $26 million in RCGB’s debt. The final purchase price will be subject to RCGB’s 2022 performance. The PSE suspended MACAY under the Substantial Acquisition Rule, which requires a company to provide comprehensive disclosure for any transaction with a value greater than 10% the acquiring company’s book value. ***MB Quick Take:*** *This rule is in place to allow investors the chance to learn more about the financial background of the company or assets acquired, and to hear from the horse’s mouth how the acquisition will impact the company’s earnings and strategy going forward. Without this kind of pause, insiders and those in their orbit (professionals, family members, etc) would always be in a position to use their understanding of the deal and their data to front-run the retail traders who would be forced to react only to headlines. MACAY minority holders will probably want to know a lot more about the transaction, as the possibility for conflicts of interest are everywhere with Mazy’s Capital (owned by the Yao Family) being on both sides of the transaction. Is assuming RCGB’s US Dollar-denominated debt in the best interests of MACAY’s minority shareholders? It might be in the Yao Family’s best interest, but without further data, we don’t have enough info to know if the deal is good for the rest of us.*
>    - **Globe** [GLO 2146.00 ▼1.01%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=dddcd9f784a8f5663470cea4b051ca8f)] will price its SRO today. GLO said that the SRO price would be a 15-25% discount off of the volume weighted market price. Pricing dates are not like deadlines, so we could hear the final price later today, or maybe even some time tomorrow. ***MB Quick Take:*** *If GLO uses the volume-weighted average of the previous month, then I’d say that we’ll probably see an SRO price in the range of ₱1650 to ₱1950 based on the discount range they provided. However, the longer the period (3 months, 6 months, etc), the higher the price will get. GLO was trading at around ₱3,500/share at the start of the year!*
>    - **First Gen** [FGEN 17.50 ▲1.16%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=018d4f44d02a0cd13470cea4b051ca8f)] put out a press release to announce that it will change the name of its floating storage regasification barge from “BW Paris” to “BW Batangas”.The Governor of Batangas said that the renaming of the barge shows FGEN’s “support and commitment to Batangas”. ***MB Quick Take:*** *Feels like we’re having some Ghost Month hangover here. You know it’s a slow news day when a disclosure announcing the naming of a barge is the third-most popular document opened on the EDGE disclosure servers for the day. Good for Batangas, I guess?*
>    - **Cebu Landmasters** [CLI 2.46 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ea7838dbb8744dd03470cea4b051ca8f)] confirms reports that the SEC has approved CLI’s shelf registration of ₱15 billion of bonds, and that it plans to sell a first tranche of ₱8 billion in bonds to raise money for capex and general corporate purposes. The first tranche will be ₱5 billion in principal bonds, and ₱3 billion in oversubscription. ***MB Quick Take:*** *If I were in a position to sell debt, I’d want to get it out the door sooner, rather than later, to avoid having to lock-in at higher rates. As the continued fight against inflation causes the BSP to raise interest rates, the rates of all the downstream debt products (like bonds) will also need to rise to remain competitive. This “beauty pageant of debt” is what has caused the sharp decline in REIT sector stock prices, as prices range lower to find the new competitive yields relative to the yields of bonds and other debt products.*
>    - **Leisure & Resorts World Corporation** [LR 1.56 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=d911242bd64d0a2f3470cea4b051ca8f)] board voted to change the company’s name to “DigiPlus Corporation” to better align with the company’s focus on “innovative technological platforms”. It also changed its address from Ortigas Center to the EcoPrime building in Taguig as part of its desire for a “new corporate image” to suit “the Company's new brand”. ***MB Quick Take:*** *It’s the continued evolution of this company that started life back in 1957 selling fertilizer as Atlas Fertilizer Corporation. In the mid-90s, the company evolved into its second form, which was that of a real-estate developer focused on leisure and recreation. More recently, the company evolved again to get into physical gaming (bingo parlors) and, even more recently, digital gaming through its subsidiary, “Total Gamezone Xtreme”. From a Google discovery and uniqueness perspective, “DigiPlus” is kind of a terrible name that won’t allow the company’s image and brand to shine that brightly without additional (significant) work. That said, it’s not like “Leisure & Resorts World” was a masterpiece in branding either, and they’ve done alright with that.*
>    - **Raslag** [ASLAG 2.20 ▼2.22%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=21ad3a9fc1e416853470cea4b051ca8f)] boys continue buying up ASLAG shares through T.G.N. Realty Corporation, an affiliate owned by ASLAG Chairman, Peter Nepomuceno, and director, Arsenio Valdes. TGN bought 500,000 shares on Tuesday. ***MB Quick Take:*** *These two keep buying up shares, as they have since the day of the IPO. I don’t mention it because I think there’s something wrong with this: what they do with their own money is their own business. At some point, though, these shares will chip away at the public float to a point where their purchases may be constrained by the PSE’s rule that companies must maintain at a public float level of at least 20%.*
>    - **JG Summit** [JGS 50.50 ▼4.72%] [[link](https://business.inquirer.net/361140/gotyme-eyes-5-5m-users-in-3-years?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1662509953-1)] hopes that its joint venture digital bank, GoTyme Bank, will have 5.5 million users in three years (2025). GoTyme recently announced a partnership with BancNet and Visa to provide a “hybrid” debit card for the Philippine market. The link with BancNet gives the card functionality with local ATMs and point-of-sales machines, and the link with Visa gives the card utility as an international/online payment option. ***MB Quick Take:*** *We have been hearing about “banking the unbanked” for over a decade now. The financial industry is desperate to bring as much of the country’s population into its system as possible, the government (through the BSP’s digitization mandate) is doing what it can to encourage this shift. As we’ve seen with the digital payment platforms, what starts out as a way for the unbanked to make payments and participate in commerce quickly devolves into a race to use that network to sell loans and other debt products. I’m not saying that GoTyme Bank is setting out down this path only to get to the sweet sweet fruit that grows from the Tree of Lending to the Lower Classes, but I am saying that over the years I have been consistently disappointed by companies that push altruistic marketing only to hide predatory terms in their products that serve to exploit the very people it sets out to help. Fingers crossed, but I’ve been taught by past performance to keep my default configuration set to “skeptical”.*

>- **[NEWS]     PHA's acquisition of SquidPay stake is in shambles...** The board of directors for Premiere Horizon Alliance [PHA 0.27 ▲1.89%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=8be71f9212f55d3b3470cea4b051ca8f)] voted to stop its acquisition of SquidPay Technology Inc (SPTI), owned by Marvin Dela Cruz, as was planned under the Memorandum of Agreement signed between the previous PHA ownership group and the Marvin Dela Cruz (MDC) ownership group. The board said that the acquisition of SPTI was no longer “in the best interest of PHA and its shareholders” because SPTI was not a “viable business”. The PHA board noted that the agreement permitted PHA and MDC to “discuss” how MDC would pay for the remaining ₱554 million due from the MDC investor group, but said that attempts to reach MDC over “the past several months” to negotiate valuations have been “unsuccessful”. PHA said that it even sent “formal letters” to MDC, but still did not hear back. PHA said that since it will no longer accept SPTI shares as payment, that the MDC investor group must settle the remaining amount in cash, and that it must do so by October 29, 2022. PHA ended the disclosure talking about developments in its legacy pursuits in real estate and mining.
>    - ***MB:*** *This backdoor takeover was born ugly, and it’s going to die ugly, too. Back when it was first announced, I called out the wishy-washy language that allowed Marvin Dela Cruz to satisfy his obligations with “cash and/or SPTI shares” ([here](https://mailchi.mp/fbace2d31aec/pha-acquired-by-squidpay-investor-group-backdoor-listing?e=933945058a), and [here](https://mailchi.mp/f31921e245d7/spacex-wants-to-give-ph-satellite-broadband-by-q3?e=933945058a)). The deal was being branded as a SquidPay backdoor of PHA, but the agreement didn’t require PHA to acquire any of SquidPay, so it always felt as though there was a foundational disconnect between Marvin Dela Cruz and the previous PHA ownership group on where PHA was going and how it was going to get there. Since then, I’ve received several private messages from insiders that said PHA’s old and new ownership groups were not cooperating, and that Marvin Dela Cruz was absent from important planning and governance meetings. This caused uncertainty within PHA’s ranks, and with PHA’s stakeholders. Then we saw revelations that a member of Marvin Dela Cruz’s own “investor group”, Brandon Leong,  had sued him for non-payment of a ₱100 million convertible loan, seeking a large chunk of Marvin’s PHA shares to satisfy the debt. It looks like Marvin used this loan to pay for a big part of his downpayment for his PHA shares, and now Marvin can’t pay back the original loan to Brandon and PHA is no longer interested in receiving “unviable” SquidPay shares. What an absolute mess. But wasn’t it this way from the beginning? There were questions looming over SquidPay’s “viability” from the very start. The agreement didn’t signal any certain outcomes, and it was unclear how ownership and control would proceed under the uncomfortably-long period that Marvin had to perfect his claim to the shares he bought. Reminds me of an old saying: The best time to not accept janky SquidPay shares as payment for a debt was 20 years ago, the second best time is now. I wonder if MDC and SquidPay will be able to make payment on that [₱900 million acquisition of a 60% stake](https://mailchi.mp/57bd45be89ad/squidpay-buys-aba-subsidiary-bank-to-file-for-digital-bank-license?e=933945058a) in Phil Star Development Bank, the subsidiary of AbaCore [ABA 2.22 unch]?*

>- **[NEWS]     Raslag accelerates disbursement of IPO proceeds by 6 months...** Raslag [ASLAG 1.68 ▲1.20%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=1627187a5eaeb91c3470cea4b051ca8f)], the solar power generation company owned by the Nepomuceno Family, disclosed that its board has voted to re-allocate the disbursement schedule of its IPO proceeds to spend ₱380 million in mid-November of this year on paying the balance owed on the land for RASLAG-4, and funding the equity portion for RASLAG-4’s construction and development. The original schedule called for this to happen sometime in the first half of next year. ASLAG also noted that the board approved a ₱250 million loan from affiliate companies. ASLAG did not say why it is accelerating the RASLAG-4 project, nor did it say how the proceeds of the loan would be used.
>    - ***MB:*** *I’ve been a vocal opponent of a board’s ability to make changes to the disbursement plan of its IPO proceeds, but that’s usually because these changes are not obviously to the benefit of minority shareholders. Think of CTS Global [CTS 0.85 ▲1.19%] taking investor cash to push into three specific foreign markets, then when it gets the cash, suddenly changing plans to add a fourth market, and then later deciding to just hold on to most of the money for half a year and do nothing with it. Or think of Solar Philippines [SPNEC 1.12 ▲3.70%] taking investor cash to push into a development-stage solar project in Nueva Ecija, then suddenly deciding to use the proceeds of the IPO to buy boring operational projects from its parent company, then deciding to raise more money, then deciding to basically backdoor list its parent company. That’s not what ASLAG is doing here. They’re putting IPO investor cash to work sooner than anticipated. They’re deploying the money to spend on site development and construction in November, instead of mid-2023, and this means that investors have a higher chance of seeing the benefit of that investment (income from the operating facility) that much sooner. While the ASLAG board hasn’t provided much context to the change to minority shareholders to help those who invested to gain confidence in the appropriateness of the board’s actions, at least the moves are not obviously anti-minority.*

>- **[NOTES] Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) [[link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-13/philippine-central-bank-chief-makes-case-for-75-basis-point-hike)] Governor Felipe Medalla said the question on the next interest rate hike is just “whether it is 50 or 75 basis points”. The BSP has meetings scheduled for mid-November and mid-December, and rate hikes from both meetings are possible. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *As noted by the Governor, a 75bp move would help fortify the peso against a massively strong US Dollar, and would help ease the parts of the inflationary soup that are being caused by an oversupply of money in the domestic financial system. It would also unfortunately “drag” on the economic recovery. Every action at the central bank level picks winners and losers, and the current Governor sounds like he’s willing to be more aggressive to fight inflation and reduce the rate of the peso’s devaluation relative to the Dollar.*
>    - **Metrobank [MBT 50.05 ▲1.83%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=8be004184bc934143470cea4b051ca8f)] shortens the offer period for its ₱10 billion bond sale because of high demand. The original end of the offer was scheduled to be October 19th, but MBT moved that up to October 17th. The bonds pay 5% per year, and have a tenor of 1.5 years. MBT plans to use the proceeds for “general working capital needs.” 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *They haven’t sold out yet, so this is more of a marketing press release than it is anything else. There was never any doubt the bonds would sell, and moving the offer period end up a couple of days doesn’t really matter in the long run. It would matter if they extended the offer period, because they didn’t sell all the bonds, or if they decided to sell additional bonds from their ₱200 billion board-approved plan, but that’s not the case. It’s just a (well-executed) feel good post.*
>    - **Department of Finance (DoF) [[link](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/10/14/dof-backs-extending-lower-tariff-on-rice-pork/)] is backing a move to extend the lower tariffs on certain commodities like corn, coal, pork, and rice. DoF is hoping this will help prevent “price shocks” should the executive orders lapse without renewal. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *Tariffs are a tax that our government imposes on certain imported goods, and these tax levels are incredibly important to food producers that are in industries that have really thin margins. Companies and producers can only eat higher input costs for so long before it becomes more profitable to shut down than to keep producing, especially in low-margin industries that didn’t have a lot of cushion to begin with. Extending the lowered tariffs doesn’t decrease the price of these basic commodities. The government is in complete control of these tax levels. There’s nothing inevitable about any of it. If the government wants to double the cost of pork, it can, and if it wants to reduce the amount that it taxes imported coal, it can. Any raise in these taxes will eventually make their way through the system to the consumer. It’s always the consumer that pays in the end.*

**US Federal Reserve** raised rates 75 basis points overnight, and signaled that additional rate raises may be required, and that its monetary tightening policy (higher rates) may need to be in play longer than originally thought. The **Dow Jones Industrial Average** dropped around 500 points (about -1.5%) after **Jerome Powell**, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, said that it would be ""very premature"" to talk about a pause in raising interest rates.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[Q3]     Semirara Mining & Power Q3 profit ▲153% y/y to ₱10 billion...** Semirara Mining & Power [SCC 33.80 ▼3.29%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=5628192e5d1fa38b3470cea4b051ca8f)] posted a Q3 profit of ₱10.1 billion, up 153% from its Q3/21 profit of ₱4 billion, and down 6% from its Q2/22 profit of ₱10.8 billion. SCC’s 9M profit is ▲249% y/y to ₱36 billion, which is already more than double SCC’s net profit for the entirety of FY21. Predictably, SCC credits this outlandish return on a combination of exceedingly high coal prices, SCC-record levels of coal production, and high spot electricity prices. SCC noted that Q3 is normally its “slowest” due to bad weather and “sluggish” demand. This was demonstrated by the data, which showed that while SCC easily cleared its Q3 mark from the previous year (thanks again to those elevated prices and production rates), it failed to beat its net profit posted the previous quarter this year, finishing Q3 about 6% lower.
>    - ***MB:*** *While the price of coal per ton is down 20-25% as compared to most of Q2, all of the major factors that combined to create the meteoric coal price rise are not only still in play, but in many ways they’re actually primed to get a whole lot worse. Or better, I guess, if you’re looking at it from SCC’s perspective. But from literally almost anyone else’s perspective, it’s going to get a lot worse. The fuel supply rhetoric between Russia and the rest of Europe was ratcheted up considerably when the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipelines, owned by Russia’s Gazprom, were shut down in late September after underwater explosions were noticed by Norway and Denmark, and huge leaks were detected. Huge portions of Europe are entering the winter months now without a consistent supply of natural gas for heating, and many countries are spinning up coal-fired power plants to try and fill as much of the energy demand gap as possible. But it’s not like “more coal” just appears out of nowhere. When more people want a thing, the price of the thing goes up. This is setting up to be a huge year for SCC.*

>- **[Q3]     Apollo Global Capital Q3 “profit” ▲40% y/y to a net loss of just ₱18 million...** Apollo Global Capital [APL 0.03 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=cec45d08b8add3bc3470cea4b051ca8f)] posted a Q3 net loss of ₱18.4 million, up 40% from its Q3/21 net loss of ₱30.6 million,  and up 10% from its Q2/22 net loss of ₱20.5 million. APL’s 9M net loss was 18% larger y/y. APL is the country’s first off-shore mining firm, which was created to rip iron ore out of the seabed and ship the ore to China. For the 7th straight quarter since insisting that its mining ship was “in position” to begin operations, APL failed to actually do any mining and therefore also failed to recognize any revenue. APL did note that its “general and administrative costs” have gone up nearly 15%, due to “repairs and maintenance” (of a boat that hasn’t done any work), “representation & entertainment”, and “salaries & employee benefits”.
>    - ***MB:*** *Sounds like APL owners and staff have been having a great time on the shareholders’ dime. Still no operations, and even worse, costs are up because of entertainment, salaries, and benefits. For what? The only thing of note that APL has done is sell more shares of itself to the public, which it used to buy a minority stake in the boat that it still hasn’t even managed to use yet. A year and a half ago, APL shares were worth ₱0.32. The boat was in position. Operations were imminent. Just waiting for that rough weather to clear so the waves would die down. Three months later, the shares are worth ₱0.18. Boat is in position. Three months later, the shares are worth ₱0.11. Are they fighting to get ore up off the seabed? Nope. They’re focused on a follow-on offering to raise some money to invest it in the holding company that owns the boat. Three months later, the shares are worth ₱0.07. No updates. Three months later, the shares are worth ₱0.05. Silence. Three months later, the shares are worth ₱0.04. Nothing. Three months later, today, the shares are worth ₱0.028. By this point, what’s further underwater? APL’s theoretical iron ore, or APL itself?*

>- **[NOTES] Quick takes from around the market...**

>    - **Ayala Corp** [AC 656.00 ▼1.65%] [[link](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/11/02/2220808/ayala-keen-logistics-expansion)] was in the news talking about its interest in acquiring a cold storage company, and this lines up with its rumored interest in the purchase of Glacier Megafridge, a 2nd-tier private cold storage company. The acquisition is supposedly being made by AC’s internal logistics unit, AC Logistics Holdings (ACLH), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AC. The deal does not appear to involve AyalaLand Logistics Holdings [ALLHC 3.22 unch], the Zobel Family’s publicly-listed “logistics” company. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *ALLHC’s Q3 teaser showed how profitable cold storages can be. There’s a ton of interest in this space, but as I’ve written about several times, the oligarchs are on the outside looking in. The biggest names in cold storage logistics are all private, non-public, and profitable. Glacier Megafridge is not one of those big names, but it’s a reasonable addition to any cold storage portfolio. I’d almost rather see ACLH buy the cold storage properties out of ALLHC, then bundle Glacier into that pack and then make THAT offering into a company that I can invest in directly without having to take on all of AC’s other baggage. I’d say to wrap it all up into a REIT, but REIT valuations have been decimated and are still in the crosshairs for more pain.*
>    - **Fruitas** [FRUIT 1.00 ▼1.96%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=7e6cdfb90cd455a13470cea4b051ca8f)] board voted to shuffle the allocation of IPO proceeds slightly to increase the amount of capital that would be put toward “Acquisition opportunities and introduction of new concepts” from ₱135 million to ₱154 million. The increase was cobbled together from unused portions of a land acquisitions tranche, the offer expenses tranche, and the tranche that was originally allocated to the expansion of the commissary. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *You know how I feel about boards and their ability to reallocate IPO proceeds. I don’t like it. I want the PSE to change the rules to require minority shareholder approval for any changes. Part of the reason for this is that we get so little information on what is being done. If I were a FRUIT shareholder, I’d want FRUIT to make the case for why it makes sense to divert money away from the commissary. Is the commissary going to cost less than anticipated? Did FRUIT just decide to limit its size? What kind of things will FRUIT buy or create with this money? This is wild like when Solar Philippines [SPNEC 1.19 unch] basically ripped up its prospectus in the first few months of its life, but it is an issue that I think the PSE needs to look at. I’m not saying FRUIT did anything wrong here. According to the rules, FRUIT appears to have done everything properly. But I think the rules do too little to protect the interests of the minority shareholders that make the PSE’s dreams of a massive and thriving IPO market possible.*
>    - **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas** (BSP) [[link](https://mb.com.ph/2022/10/31/bsp-forecasts-oct-inflation-of-7-1-7-9/)] projects October inflation to fall between 7.1% to 7.9%, up from September’s actual inflation rate of 6.9%. The BSP said that inflationary pressures will come from transpo fare hikes, rising oil prices, rising commodity prices due to storms, and the continued devaluation of the peso. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *Sounds like the BSP and Asian Development Bank (ADB) are in disagreement about the potential for storms to cause us inflationary problems. Remember when ADB declined to adjust its inflationary forecast for the rest of the year after Karding, and how I said that whatever was in the ADB report should be considered a best-case scenario because of this? Well, it looks like we’re no longer dealing with the best-case. I don’t know why ADB didn’t want to re-do their work to account for actual changes on the ground, but the “ground” doesn’t care too much about what the old report said. Costs are going up, and the BSP thinks that the storms will impact the affordability of food. It’s not under control yet.*

>    - **➤ The deal:** The SRO itself will see SPNEC sell 1,875,649,995 common shares to existing shareholders, at a price of between ₱1.50 to ₱1.76/share, with an entitlement ratio of 1 SRO share for every 1.28 SPNEC shares already owned by the record date, which is on August 25. Tentatively, SPNEC will price the offer on August 18, and conduct an offer period between August 30 and September 5, before finally listing the SRO shares on September 15. As Mr. Leviste notes, these dates are all tentative pending an official schedule from the PSE.
>    - **➤ The discount:** SROs are usually priced at a discount, to reward shareholders for protecting their proportional stake by participating in the capital call. The price range of ₱1.50 to ₱1.76 represents, at the low end, a discount of 10% off of SPNEC’s closing price of ₱1.67, and at the high end, a 5% premium. SPNEC wouldn’t sell the shares at a premium, so it’s obvious that SPNEC and its advisors believe that there’s a chance that SPNEC could trade higher over the next month before the pricing date, and so they’re leaving themselves some space to take advantage of that potential increase in case it happens. 
>    - **➤ The installment plan:** This is the interesting part! Anyone interested in buying SRO shares can either do it the same old boring way, by paying the full amount on the day they purchase, or the cool new way, which is in installments by providing a 25% down payment on the day they purchase, and then paying the remaining 75% at any time over the next three months. 
>    - **➤ What happens if it goes unpaid?** The prospectus calls these “delinquent Rights Shares”, and says that SPNEC reserves the right to extend the payment period for delinquent Rights Shares, or to auction delinquent Rights Shares off. SPNEC said that it might buy any delinquent Rights Shares that go without bids, and if they do, those shares would become treasury shares. SPNEC said that in the case the delinquent Rights Shares are sold at auction, any down payment made will be “forfeited in favor of SPNEC”. I followed pretty well up until that last part, when it sounded like SPNEC would sell the entire lot of shares to someone else, and then also keep the down payment. Maybe I’m reading it wrong, but it seems weird that SPNEC would keep the deposit, when the deposit represents 100% payment for 25% of the requested allocation. Doesn’t it make more sense to allow the purchaser to keep the 25% of shares that they paid for, and then auction off the unpaid 75% without any punitive forfeits? 
>    - **➤ Use of proceeds:** According to earlier disclosures, this SRO was meant to facilitate what I referred to as “hitting the turbo button”, by allowing SPNEC to purchase interests in projects with Enrique Razon’s Terra Solar and Prime Infra from its parent company, Solar Philippines. The initial disclosure said that Solar Philippines would grant SPNEC the option “to accelerate the development of the project site using the proceeds of an SRO”, where “project site” refers to the projects with Terra Solar and Prime Infra, but this updated prospectus says that the money will be put toward purchasing land for the expansion of its original Nueva Ecija site, for the benefit of its “Sta. Rosa Nueva Ecija 2 Solar Power Project”, presumably since money that would have gone toward that undertaking has been re-allocated to the purchase of that stake in the Terra Solar and Prime Infra projects.
>    - ***MB:*** *This isn’t the mega-SRO that SPNEC will need to do in the future as part of the massive share swap with its parent company, Solar Philippines. This mini-SRO was only (originally) meant to free up some capital to acquire those assets from Solar Philippines that related directly to those Enrique Razon projects. That still seems to be happening, but now it’s in more of a “money is fungible” kind of way than a situation where the proceeds from the SRO are directly applied to purchasing the stakes in the Enrique Razon projects. Either way, it’s great to get some additional information from SPNEC on the state of this SRO. My only hope is that SPNEC is able to reveal the pricing of the offer before the ex-date to allow shareholders (and potential shareholders) the chance to make a well-reasoned investment decision!*

>- **[REVIEW]     Ayala Land downgraded to “underweight” by J.P. Morgan...** Ayala Land [ALI 25.25 ▼0.79%], the real estate development arm of Ayala Corp [AC 620.00 ▼3.73%], was downgraded to “underweight” by J.P. Morgan (JPM) last week. JPM gave ALI a ₱24/share price target for June 2023, based on a wide variety of reasons, including: a slowdown in the growth of the residential real estate market, a slowdown in the recovery of commercial lease rates due to the continued success of the hybrid work model, and the growing attractiveness of other fixed-income investments like 10-year government bonds paying more than 7%. JPM also notes that ALI is one of the most widely-held Philippine stocks by foreign investors (behind International Container [ICT 184.00 ▼2.85%] and SM Investments [SM 813.00 ▼2.98%]), and that could lead to additional selling pressure if the Philippine Peso continues to slide against foreign currencies like the US Dollar.
>    - ***MB:*** *From a price perspective, ALI’s performance has been brutal. ALI has lost 36% of its value since late February, when it was worth nearly ₱40/share. The stock is trading at levels that we haven’t seen since the actual day of the Great COVID Crash on 19 March 2020, and before that, back in February of 2014. Gone are the days where this stock traded in the low/mid ₱30s without a giving long-term investors any real scares to the downside. That long-lost Range of Comfort ended in early May, when we got confirmation of April’s huge inflation jump. ALI’s stock price immediately dropped, and hasn’t looked back. With interest rates rising to combat inflation to the point where government 10-year bonds are paying above 7%, that might also give us some solid context for why the REIT sector has deflated over the same timeline. Cost of debt is going up hurts residential sales. Continued pandemic and inflation pressures extend work-from-home push and htat hurts commercial leasing. The icing on the turd cake: selling pressure from foreign investors if the peso’s weakness relative to foreign currencies continues or gets worse. While I’ve spend some time walking through this JPM analysis, this is just one of the many sophisticated takes on the glass-half-full / glass-half-empty ALI situation. Some stories tout ALI’s [strong fundamentals](https://www.manilatimes.net/2022/06/27/business/stock-watch/ayala-land-fundamentals-remain-intact/1848817), others point to the [successful bond sale](https://manilastandard.net/business/corporate/314241259/ayala-land-raises-p33b-from-bond-sale.html) as a reason for hope. There are a wide range of opinions on this issue, but I wanted to share JPM’s because it was relatively data-driven, and multi-layered in a way that I haven’t seen for quite some time.*

JGS refers to the facility as the first 5-star integrated casino resort in the Visayas/Mindanao region. JGS is hoping to drive patronage to NUSTAR through integrations with its other subsidiary, Cebu Pacific [CEB 41.70 ▼1.30%]. The resort will cater to domestic and SE Asian clients, with a focus on (of course) Chinese gamblers. This is JGS’s first move into the high-end entertainment space, and I’m curious to see how the group will manage “top tier” experiences here.

All of these moves are meant to facilitate the company’s move into “agri- tourism and bamboo industry”. At least they’re not getting into crypto and solar?

At first glance, it looks like a bigger deal than it is. It’s tempting to note that Mr. Lee’s buys were like 85% of all CTS shares traded on July 7th, but his buys were only 4% of the traded volume on July 11th and the price didn’t really go anywhere on either day. CTS bagholders are probably happy for the support, even if it’s getting harder and harder to hold their breath.

Congrats to the three Grab Voucher winners! Only June Christian was able to get back to me by the time of this writing, so check your inboxes this morning and maybe you'll join June as a voucher winner! 

I got a lot of inquiries about the thing I wrote yesterday about deal toys. Seems that there is a lot of interest in ""IPO rewards"". One reader, DanielO, even suggested that MB should make its own deal toys! That would be hilarious. I'm picturing the first one for Prime Infra just being a bunch of stuff that Dennis Uy used to own, that he was forced to sell to Enrique Razon to make debt payments. Haha. Let me know if there's interest and I'll put out some feelers...

Thanks to JL DL for the compliments, and to david calo for signing on as a patron at the ""Ministop Coffee"" level!

>- **[NEWS]     Citicore Energy REIT declares stable Q2 dividend...** Citicore Energy REIT [CREIT 2.40 ▲0.84%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ee71fb40a2250b983470cea4b051ca8f)], the country’s only REIT play with no interests in the struggling commercial office space sector, declared a Q2 dividend of ₱0.044/share, for shareholders of record as of August 19, payable on September 14. This dividend is identical to the one CREIT declared in Q1, and when annualized, represents a dividend yield of 7.33% at yesterday’s closing price of ₱2.40/share, and represents a nice (but somewhat lower) annualized dividend yield of 6.9% relative to CREIT”s IPO price of ₱2.55/share.
>    - ***MB:*** *This REIT has a few x-factors. The first is that it has absolutely no exposure to the continuing softness in the commercial leasing space that could cast a negative light on all the other REITs on the PSE which rely, to some extent, on strong demand from BPOs to support commercial office lease rates. CREIT’s quarterly dividends represent the “base” income that it receives from leases for land used to generate solar power, and the electricity generated has only gone up in value due to a combination of depressingly-predictable short supply of electricity, and the tidal wave of inflation that has driven energy prices upward. This raises the other x-factor, which is that the “base” quarterly dividends are only part of the overall yield picture for CREIT, as it will provide a special dividend at the end of the year from the other stream of income that it earns from revenue sharing agreements with the power plants. CREIT investors have not had a chance to see and feel the impact of this dividend yet, but projecting the potential size of this dividend is important to the accurate projection of CREIT’s annual yield. With electricity spot prices “elevated” and climbing, I think this signals a healthy special dividend Christmas present, but I haven’t had the chance to truly dig in and build a model to help me predict the size/shape of this dividend. Once I do, I will incorporate it into CREIT’s projected dividend yield. Until then, please note that my projections only include the “base”/regular dividends. This is what long-term investing looks like: building models of increasing complexity, in an attempt to better predict the value of something. All models are inaccurate, though, so the sisyphean task is to continually re-tool and re-factor to get as close as possible to the asymptote which is perfect accuracy. To some, that probably sounds bleak. I love the challenge, and the continual learning that is required to do it!*

The shares are controlled by Jerry Liu through his private holdcos, with the majority belonging to Camerton Holdings.

Oh and an asset sale. Take the asset sale out, and BPI still booked “record” revenue for Q2, at ₱27.3 billion, and a net profit of ₱8.7 billion (up 31% y/y). No guidance yet from BPI on how high-and-rising inflation, and the rate increases to battle it, will impact earnings going forward.

Not sure how the SUN board thought the parent’s name change qualifies as material, and yet the arrest and detention of the parent’s owner on charges of facilitating [illegal cross-border gambling and money laundering](https://mailchi.mp/87c386fc5b7d/unionbank-is-reportedly-primed-to-take-citigroups-retail-assets?e=933945058a) would not have ”any direct material adverse impact” on SUN.

>- **[Q2]     Semirara Mining and Power Q2 profit ▲170% y/y, but ▼28% from last quarter...** Semirara Mining and Power [SCC 40.85 ▲0.74%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=9ba922756a3df0d03470cea4b051ca8f)] published a pre-earnings teaser to report a Q2/22 profit of ₱10.8 billion, up 170% from Q2/21 profit of ₱4 billion, and down 28% from Q1/22 profit of ₱15 billion. SCC attributed the performance to “all-time high coal selling prices”, combined with a larger quantity of spot electricity sold at higher-than-normal rates. SCC’s H1 net income was up 311% y/y to ₱25.8 billion. SCC said that its quarter-on-quarter performance was weaker (“as expected”) due to the lockdowns in China, which reduced demand for SCC’s coal shipments. The company said that its Q2 coal shipments fell by 25% as China imposed lockdowns and “shifted to Russian coal,” but that the reduced shipments were somewhat off-set by the 126% increase in the selling price of coal.
>    - ***MB:*** *I really want to know more about that somewhat ominous line, about how the 25% dip in coal shipments was caused, in part, to China’s shift to Russian coal. As far back as April, [newsrooms](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-20/china-buys-cheap-coking-coal-from-russia-as-world-shuns-moscow) have been publishing stories about China’s opportunistic approach to buying the steeply discounted coal that Russia has been selling since many of its traditional coal buyers moved to ban imports of Russian fuel exports like coal and oil. China is SCC’s largest market when it comes to coal sales, so I’m curious whether this 25% dip is stable, or if that was just the tip of the iceberg? Will SCC pivot away from China to sell coal to other international buyers at prices that are closer to the “everything except Russia” elevated spot price, or will SCC try to compete with the “double dirty” discounted Russian coal? It doesn’t look like the Russia/Ukraine conflict is ending any time soon, and the same goes for all of the sanctions imposed against Russia as a result of its actions in the region. The discounted coal problem could be one that persists for a long time. What are SCC’s plans to deal with this?*

First half results showed CNPF’s consolidated net revenue was up 15% y/y to ₱31.1 billion, and despite higher input prices due to inflation and supply chain issues, CNPF saw its gross margins grow by 20 basis points to 25.1%. It’s H1/22 net profit of ₱3 billion was 9% higher than H1/21. CNPF’s largest business segment, the branded business, grew sales by over 18% in the first half of the year, while the Tuna and Coconut OEM Exports segment grew 6%, due in large part to forex pricing benefits and the easing of some supply chain issues. Looking forward, CNPF’s Executive Chairman, Christopher Po, said that the company expects to see lower prices for some of its key inputs, “like tuna, packaging, and freight.”

If we do some rough math and annualize their H1 results, we can see that if they maintain the pace they set, they’d deliver an EPS of ₱1.67 for 2022. That’s an incredible 27% y/y growth. Now, there’s a lot of life between now and then, and a lot of things can push and drag CNPF’s earnings, but it seems like CNPF is doing a great job of consistently delivering earnings growth in a hyper-competitive market. It’s not like they’re just squatting on dominated markets, either; the group is making educated bets in new product areas to build future shareholder value. There was a time where I was dismissive of what the Po Family had accomplished, especially during the pandemic when the rush to shelf-stable products really boosted CNPF’s bottom-line, but I think we’re seeing that the force majeure windfall of the pandemic was just a layer of good fortune for CNPF shareholders that rested on top of a powerful upward trend that existed both before and after the depths of the pandemic.*

>    - **Philex Mining** [PX 3.16 ▼0.94%] [[link](https://www1.pse.com.ph/stockMarket/companyInfo.html?id=137&security=331&tab=0)] listed its 842 million SRO shares yesterday morning, which shareholders of record had the chance to purchase at ₱3.15/share. The share price tipped lower by a percent, closing at ₱3.16/share, just ₱0.01 higher than the SRO’s price. Trading volume was unusually heavy (1.8 million shares) as compared to the ~1 million shares that PX averaged in daily trade volume since the end of June. This suggests to me that (some) PX SRO buyers might not have a lot of conviction about PX’s medium- and long-term prospects, and may have only been in it to flip it.
>    - **Filinvest Land** [FLI 0.91 unch] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=1e926ad6fb03718b3470cea4b051ca8f)] teases a 7% increase in H1 y/y  consolidated revenues, to ₱9.1 billion. FLI attributed the growth to “accelerated construction progress and strong performance of its housing projects”. Noticeably, FLI was silent on the net income/loss that it managed to squeeze out of this single-digit growth. Sure, FLI’s Q2/22 revenue beat its Q2/21 revenue by 7%, but it made a ₱1.09 billion profit off that Q2/21 lower revenue last year. So far, this year, FLI has made ₱678 million off of ₱4.14 billion in Q1/22. If FLI’s profitability is in-line with its “historical” Q2 performance, it would have generated about ₱1.4 billion in profit, but if the performance more closely resembles what it did in the first quarter of 2022, then we’d expect about ₱0.81 billion in profit. That’s a pretty wide margin, but the lack of data on net income leads me to suspect that it’s closer to the lower of the two (super) rough estimates.
>    - **Department of Finance** (DoF) [[link](https://www.rappler.com/business/diokno-banks-mining-economic-recovery-philippines/?utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_source=Facebook)] has a new-found crush on mining. DoF Secretary Diokno said that the mining industry holds the “greatest potential to be a key driver in our economic recovery and long-term growth”, due in part to our country’s “rich endowment” of mineral resources, but also to the uncharacteristically-high prices of metals and minerals in the global market. The Secretary isn’t wrong, but we (and many other countries around the world) have a pretty terrible track record when it comes to exploiting these resources in a way that doesn’t end up feeling kind of gross and near-sighted. Should we prepare for another generational blossom of mining companies that will become the backdoor listing shell companies when the price of metal inevitably goes in the other direction? At least we’ll add to our crop of non-operational shell companies.

Hearing lots of anecdotes about rapid COVID outbreaks in workplaces and social circles. Be careful. Also seeing lots of concern about inflation in the US, and some guidance from the US Fed about raising rates sooner than expected (March-ish) to fight inflation. For those that trade US markets, or strategies that use the US markets as a signal for PSE stocks, take a look at what happened in Wednesday's US trading session. Major sell-off.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]     Haus Talk [HTI 1.50 pre-IPO] clarifies news that its IPO is oversubscribed...** A couple of days ago, the [Inquirer reported that the HTI IPO was oversubscribed](https://business.inquirer.net/338106/haus-talk-kicks-off-2022-ipo-lineup-with-offering-now-sold-out), quoting the HTI Chairman as saying that the shares for the institutional tranche were “[e]ssentially all committed already”, and quoting HTI’s underwriter, Investment and Capital Corp. of the Philippines (ICCP), as saying that “[w]e just started and we’re fully sold out”, and that the offering would be “well oversubscribed” by the end of the week. HTI, through ICCP, [issued a clarification](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=df2bce02c28dfea83470cea4b051ca8f) specifically about the institutional tranche, which ICCP notes is the only tranche that it has complete control over. ICCP said that the tranche was, in fact, not sold out yet, but did note that the offer period was still on-going, that there were strong indications of interest for the offering based on the final terms, and that final subscriptions will only be verified and confirmed at the end of the offer period.
>    - ***MB:*** *Quite the walk-back by HTI and ICCP. To go from “we’re sold out” to “there are no oversubscriptions” is a serious change, but one that is probably understandable to anyone that has ever done media coaching and preparation for executives that speak to the public. It can be very difficult for people with incredible amounts of non-public and/or technical background information on a transaction to avoid making statements that go too far when speaking to people outside the transaction, that inch across the line during a moment of excitement from innocent cheerleading to problematic. Statements made by promoters and underwriters about IPOs during the IPO process are regulated, and everyone involved is careful to stick to the law so as to not attract unwanted attention. The challenge is when people move from the private sphere to the public sphere, or from the casual sphere to the formal. Here, maybe ICCP’s original statement about being “sold out” was made in the way that bankers talk to one another over coffees or after a few drinks, that comes with an understanding that it’s not technically sold until it’s sold; but the regulators don’t allow bankers to assume that we (the investing public) share that understanding, so representations about the status of the sale need to be accurate as to the actual status of the shares in the tranche. I’m sure HTI is very excited about the process, and that ICCP is pumped right alongside HTI to get the sale done and the shares listed. Seems like a good faith misstep that was fixed with a clear explanation. The retail offer starts tomorrow (Friday, January 7th) and runs until January 17th.*

>- **[NEWS]     D.M. Wenceslao [DMW 6.68 ▼1.18%] signs Landers to 25-year lease for plot in Aseana City...** The exact terms of the lease were not disclosed, but from what we do know, the [25-year land lease](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=83113a2f10a180823470cea4b051ca8f) is for a 15,064 sqm parcel of land in DMW’s Aseana City development. Landers is a subscription shopping superstore concept, similar to Puregold [PGOLD 38.75 ▼1.52%] subsidiary, S&R. DMW said that the deal will provide recurring income to the company and diversify its client base while acting as a ‘draw” for shoppers and foot traffic to the development that will benefit existing stores.
>    - ***MB:*** *These huge anchor-tenant type leases are highly prized, not only for the obvious recurring revenue from the lease itself, but from the physical foot traffic that a store like this can provide. If you’ve ever gone to S&R in BGC, and then taken the opportunity to pick up some things from the Mercury Drug by St. Luke’s while you were in the area, then you’ve demonstrated the exact behavior that DMW is hoping will benefit its other tenants. It also (could) allow DMW to charge more for subsequent tenants, especially once DMW is able to demonstrate increased foot-traffic metrics once the Landers store is up and running. On an aside, it’s nice to see some large leases getting signed.*

>- **[NEWS]     Philippine Stock Exchange [PSE 215.00 ▲1.90%] prepping for 10 IPOs in 2022...** Philstar ran a [2022 preview piece](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/01/03/2151427/least-10-firms-make-pse-debut-year) about the PSE’s ten 2022 IPOs, starting with the Haus Talk [HTI 1.50 pre-IPO] IPO on January 17th. Figaro Coffee Group [FCG 0.75 pre-IPO] goes next on January 24th, then Citicore REIT [CREIT 3.15 pre-IPO] follows on February 17th. None of the other IPOs listed in the article are even at the tentative date stage yet, so we’ll have to wait for SEC approval to get a better idea of the specific schedule for the seven other IPOs that will come later. In that group of later IPOs are two REITs, one from SM Prime Holdings [SMPH 34.35 ▲2.54%] and one from Vista Land & Lifescapes [VLL 3.49 ▲2.05%], another Villar joint, PAVI Green (a power producer), the Fruitas [FRUIT 1.24 ▲1.64%] subsidiary, Balai ni Fruitas, San Miguel Corp’s [SMC 112.90  unch] Bank of Commerce, Ada Manufacturing Corp., and North Star Meat Merchants. The article did not mention Ovialand, the mass-market housing developer that is aiming for a 2022 IPO, nor did it mention the Jollibee [JFC 218.40 ▲1.58%] and DoubleDragon [DD 7.05  unch] industrial REIT, CentralHub, which was also loosely slated for 2022.
>    - ***MB:*** *The PSE has several reasons to push IPOs, not the least of which is the large listing fee that the exchange is able to charge. The PSE is still a profit-seeking company, after all, and it’s usually wise to consider a company’s financial incentives when trying to predict what a company might do. The PSE is also under pressure to increase the number of viable companies on the exchange after it became widely known that the PSE trails all of its established SE Asian peers in terms of the number of companies listed on its exchange. There are other factors in play as well, namely, the continued push by property developers to take advantage of the REIT law to recycle capital for new projects, and the continued pressure on non-public firms to raise money to pay for working capital and business expansion in a challenging loan/debt environment. It’s a “perfect storm” of IPO-encouraging factors, if you will. If 2022 plays out like Q3 and Q4 of 2021 did, the major bottleneck may turn out to be the PSE itself, as it looks to push potential listings around in the name of preventing saturation and/or overlap. While I recognize the PSE’s interest in maintaining a neat schedule, I think we’re decades behind and that the time for carefully curating entrance to the public market has long since passed. Open the floodgates! The equity must flow.*

>    - **International Container** [ICT 187.20 ▼1.47%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=4a2a7339ab566db13470cea4b051ca8f)] to sell its entire interest in Davao del Norte port for ₱325 million. ICT says that “the expected market for [the port] did not materialize”. ICT will sell its interest to Hijo Resources Corp (HRC). ICT received ₱95 million as an initial cash payment from HRC, with the balance due in tranches/installments over the next two years. ***MB Quick Take:*** *I don’t have a lot of insight into Enrique Razon or his port operations, but this looks like a “win” for ICT in terms of converting an underperforming asset into cash that it can use for almost anything else. As a shareholder, these “optimization” moves are greatly appreciated.*
>    - **Alternergy** [ALTER 1.48 pre-SEC] [[link](https://twitter.com/michelle_d_ong/status/1569541039479992328)] is reportedly “all systems GO” for a November IPO, according to [ABS-CBN’s Michelle Krystle Ong](https://twitter.com/michelle_d_ong/status/1569541039479992328). The alternative energy company was formed by former Department of Energy Secretary Vicente Perez, and has been operating as a green energy producer since 2008. ALTER is looking to raise ₱2.2 billion in a deal that consists of 87% primary shares. ***MB Quick Take:*** *I love the spirit, but it would be a nightmare if the company was anything other than “all systems go” for an IPO process that it started only a couple of months ago. While the preliminary prospectus listed November 25th as a target listing date for the IPO (based on receipt of pre-effective clearance to conduct an IPO from the SEC on October 4), the dates listed there are really just placeholders. The SEC’s decision on whether to permit the offering to go ahead doesn’t really take the dates given by the company into consideration, and even after the SEC approves, there’s still the matter of getting the PSE to put the deal on the schedule. ALTER will go on the schedule when it’s approved by the PSE, because before then, the dates are all just preferences.*
>    - **Raslag** [ASLAG 2.10 ▼6.25%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=349004eaae5260c43470cea4b051ca8f)] buy-back boys keep the buy-back party going with another huge round of buying on Monday. T.G.N. Realty Corporation (TGN), an affiliate company owned by ASLAG’s Chairman and one of its directors, purchased 1 million shares on the 12th, which was about 12% of the volume on that day. ***MB Quick Take:*** *Just following the story, paying one eye’s worth of attention to what the BBBs (buy-back boys) are doing. I haven’t spent any real time with the data to get a feel for how impactful TGN’s purchases have been, but the ownership group has acquired millions of shares since the IPO, and that’s got to have a positive impact by soaking up low-hanging asks.*
>    - **Megaworld** [MEG 2.41 ▼2.03%] [[link](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2022/09/14/megaworld-continues-tie-up-with-landers/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=megaworld-continues-tie-up-with-landers)] to host another Landers Superstore location in Bacolod City township development, The Upper East. MEG has signed Landers to leases at four other MEG township locations. ***MB Quick Take:*** *These kinds of anchor tenants are really important to the financial health of a project. For developers like MEG, who do not have a dominant, in-house grocery brand, there’s always a little uncertainty in terms of who can or will take the space, and at what rate. At least for developers like the Villars, they know that they could always cause AllHome [HOME 3.81 ▲0.53%] or AllDay Marts [ALLDY 0.33 unch] to swoop in and sign friendly lease deals to prop up new developments. Same for DoubleDragon [DD 7.35 ▼0.14%] through its sister company, MerryMart [MM 1.33 ▼1.48%]. The lack of an in-house, mid-market brand doesn’t appear to have slowed MEG, but it is an added complication.*
>    - **PwC MAP 2022 CEO Survey** [[link](https://www.pwc.com/ph/en/publications/ceo-insights-surveys/ceo-survey-2022.html)] showed that 87% of the 119 Philippine CEOs were “confident” that their company would “experience revenue growth in the next 12 months”, but 52% said that full recovery from COVID-19 would probably take more than two years. ***MB Quick Take:*** *When asked about what is likely to cause a recovery delay, you’d think those CEOs would mention something about inflation challenges, maybe some hot takes about the rising cost of capital, but no. The #1 complaint is corruption. 67% of CEOs said that corruption is what would cause the recovery delay. The CEOs surveyed said that the top 3 priorities for the incoming administration to help the business community would be government accountability/transparency, fighting corruption, and attracting more foreign investments.*
>    - **Philippine Telegraph and Telephone** [PTT susp] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ae04dc908b06705f3470cea4b051ca8f)] board voted to remove restriction against foreign ownership of shares, and to increase its authorized capital stock from ₱11.8 billion to ₱16.4 billion, split between various classes of shares, with the largest being the “Class A” serial redeemable preferred stocks at ₱7.4 billion. ***MB Quick Take:*** *This is a stock that hasn’t traded in over 12 years. There are a lot of fantastic rumors that swirl about this company, which has many legacy contacts and potentially-powerful backers, but the fact is that it’s been a complete non-factor for so long that the vast majority of PSE traders have never seen PTT in active trading.*

My insights on what the government can do to tame inflation,9,xrc6q4,phinvest,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/xrc6q4/my_insights_on_what_the_government_can_do_to_tame/,15,"Here are the effects of hiking interest rates that I can think of:

\- For most businesses/corporations who has office rental expenses or loans from the bank: they will/might undergo cost-cutting of employees. Their loans will be more expensive to pay, the rental offices/location will be more expensive to pay if the owner of the property also loaned it from the bank. Thus, they will also be part of the affected when rate hikes.

\- Since a lot of businesses will probably undergo cost-cutting or mass lay-offs, unemployment rate will go higher and the supply of applicants will go high. The question for this is, will the demand for workers be able to balance out the supply of applicants going high since a lot of lay-offs will happen?

\- There may be chances that a lot of businesses who depends on loans from the bank will also go bankrupt/close since they will not be able to afford to pay the loans and also there's less flow of income since demand has gradually declined and supplies are high.

\- A lot of people will not be able to loan or not even think of getting a loan since interest rates are higher thus making loans more expensive and inaccessible for people. Or rather, removing it from their option on getting money.

\- If PHP will be higher against USD, it will not be attractive anymore for foreign investors to put up businesses here in our country since they will not be able to exploit cheap labor/cheap currency since PHP is rising against USD and it will be more expensive for them.

\- Since lay-offs will happen, unemployment rate will rise and a lot of people will not consider taking a loan, demand will go lower while supplies of products will go higher. This will now test the competitiveness of every business out there. Are you willing to lower your price so it will be more attractive for people to buy since it will be affordable compared to different brands? or will you be standing your ground on your prices because you think it is reasonable since the quality and utility of your product is mainly needed by the masses? Most of business will definitely lower their prices to stay afloat in the competition. Thus lowering inflation gradually.

\- If unemployment rate will be higher and there will be less money circulating in the hands of Filipinos, what would you think is one of the possible side effects? Crime rate will go up. Possible protests from the masses. Etc etc.

\- the circulating PHP in the economy will definitely go lower and will make PH bonds/treasury a more attractive investment.

TO THOSE WHO ARE SAYING HIKE THE RATES, ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN/WILLING TO GO THROUGH THESE SCENARIOS JUST TO TAME INFLATION? YOU MIGHT BE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL COMPLAIN IF EVER YOUR ONE OF THE MASSES WHO GOT LAID-OFF. ARE YOU WILLING TO GO THROUGH THIS PAIN FOR A BETTER TOMORROW? THIS WILL TAKE YEARS.

\- The government must prioritize exports and depend less on importing products. There really must be transparency on government spending. They need to maximize the resources here in Philippines in order to depend less on imports since a lot of exporters are actually hoarding a lot of stuff that can only be bought in US so they can sell it for USD since USD is very strong right now.

\- Agriculture, manufacturing, industrial, seafood industry etc are very strong in PH but most often being neglected by either investor/businessmen/government itself. If not neglected, they exploit farmers, fishers, laborers rather than giving them access, more benefits etc. so they can work properly and more productive.

\- Peg PHP to GOLD. Look at what Russia did, even being sanctioned by a lot of countries, those countries who sanctioned Russia are the once whos actually suffering right now. When they were sanctioned, a lot of countries dump Rubles thus causing its decline followed by closure of businesses, removing them access to products and services. But, they didn't expect that the supply of Rubles would actually decline faster than expected making it rise in value like no sanctioned happened. After that, they pegged Rubles to GOLD. Aside from that, Russia has a lot of resources that they can export like oil/gas. A lot of countries are actually looking into separating from USD as its reserve assets and considering pegging their fiat to natural resources/metals/etc. like Gold, Nickel, Silver etc. Like in the recent news, Japan dumped its US Treasuries in order to stabilize the devaluation of YEN against USD. As long as most of reserved assets and int'l loans are USD, we will be definitely affected by the US rate hikes and Dollar strength whether we like it or not, whether the government is great in doing its job or not.

On a recent BSP economic forum, someone (me, lol) brought up this concern with the forum presentors. Needless to say I was shut down by the BSP economic team using sound statistical data and macroeconomic theory. Consumer spending is at 9 to 10% of GDP and is one of the highest contributors still to our local economy. This is constantly being monitored each and every monetary policy adjustments made by the BSP. The scenario you presented is plausible. However, we are not there yet, and there are people monitoring the situation so we dont overdo the rate hikes. Delicate managing of fiscal and monetary policies, together with constant monitoring of macroeconomic fundamentals is a must in these challenging times. 

>- If PHP will be higher against USD, it will not be attractive anymore for foreign investors to put up businesses here in our country since they will not be able to exploit cheap labor/cheap currency since PHP is rising against USD and it will be more expensive for them.

A bit farfetched to think that PHP will be higher than USD at this moment. Demand for PHP is not high enough, and rate hikes alone likely wont be able to do this. 


>- Peg PHP to GOLD.

Plausible course of action. A lot of countries are considering this, though such considerations are not only economic, but political as well. Short term effects of this will definitely be felt (a bulk of BPOs have origins in North America which forms a big part of GDP. One of the biggest BPOs in the country alone is from the US and has around 100k employees. It is still growing. A gold switch may affect their business continuity operations) 
 Most of the countries doing this either have some sort of political or economic leverage (meaning the US needs them enough for them to get away with it) , or are politically averse to the US. Beyond economics this angle must be evaluated as well.  Maybe what Japan did (or something similar) is somewhat plausible for us to an extent. But something as drastic as  Russia's move? Perhaps this is too bold of a move.",1664468763.0

why do you think other countries are doing it? the effects are without a doubt painful especially for small businesses but it is necessary. short term rate hikes will eventually balance the demand/supply of goods and the market cycle continues. and even if we start fixing the import/export policies of our country now, it would take years before it will have an effect on our economy. as long as the global supply chain is affected by strict Covid policies and other events like the war, there's really not much we can do in the short term.",1664468763.0

Sometimes, we just have to understand lang din kung ano yung methods ng pagkuha ng statistics lalo at macro level na mga iyan.

My 100k is in my BDO account, I consider it as my Emergency Fund. Now that I have built my emergency fund as a teen, I am now planning to limit the percentage of my savings from 70% to 40% allowing me to invest my money (while beating inflation) on varied things such as real estate, and stocks, myself, and more!

For background, I come from a middle-class family.  I had no prior investments (this is not networking or a scam lol) All I had (and was everything) was my laptop and the skills I built throughout my school life such as academic excellence, writing, arts, graphic designing, and more!

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NOTES] Quick takes from around the market...**
>    - **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas** (BSP) [[link](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/philippine-inflation-peso-pressure-spur-talk-of-off-cycle-hike-1.1842508)] under growing pressure to declare an off-cycle rate increase to help offset the degrading situation on the ground for people trying to afford food and basic necessities. The BSP had openly committed to matching the US Federal Reserve’s 75 basis point increase, but refused to do so before its regularly-scheduled meeting on November 17th. Now, some analysts are calling on the BSP to make the increase effective now, instead of waiting, since, according to BPI economist Emilio Neri, “if we continue to delay, we might end up hiking even much, much more”. Goldman Sachs increased its estimate of the “terminal rate” (the highest the rates will eventually go) to 6%, up from 5.25%. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *This was always what I was expecting, and why I thought it was important to watch what sentiments would boil to the surface in the time between the US Fed raise and our own. As Mr. Neri implies, it’s not like anything is likely to get better for people or companies over the next two weeks. At least the peso hasn’t exploded (yet). Keep an eye on this.*
>    - **International Container Terminal Services** [ICT 190.00 ▲6.86%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=63a0c3cc9a06a3bb3470cea4b051ca8f)] Q3 profit ▲41.58% y/y, and ▲45% q/q, to US $187 million (₱10.9 billion), driven by “volume growth, cost control and operating discipline.” ICT highlighted the 7% y/y increase in shipping container “throughput” to 8.9 million TEUs (“twenty-foot equivalent unit”; a basic shipping container), and the 20% y/y increase in sales to US $1.6 billion. EBITDA was up 25% to $1.0 billion. This marks seven consecutive quarters of “double-digit consolidated revenue growth”. ICT is a globally-diversified port operator owned by Enrique Razon. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *The Razon Family has plenty of experience operating in a notoriously rough business (ports operations are legendary in this regard) in some of the roughest political and economic environments in the world. I’ll admit that ICT’s continued revenue growth is somewhat surprising to me, as I’d assumed the downturn in the Chinese economy would make it too difficult for ICT to match the performance of prior periods, but here we are: ICT is not only matching, but exceeding, what it once did, and despite the relative weakness of the Chinese market.*
>    - **Megawide** [MWIDE 3.42 ▲4.27%] [[link](https://www.philstar.com/business/2022/11/08/2222150/megawide-hikes-capital-base-p512-billion)] board voted to increase the company’s authorized capital stock by ₱36 million, all in the form of preferred shares, raising MWIDE’s total authorized capital stock from ₱5.080 billion to ₱5.116 billion. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *This move has no impact on the share price of the common shares, since this was (1) only the board authorizing the issuance of new shares, not an actual issuance, and (2) the shares are preferred shares and those are not counted when it comes to matters of equity like voting and the calculation of percentage ownership interest. The raise does give the board 36 million shares to play with, which it could turn around and sell at ₱100/each to raise up to ₱3.6 billion. While it’s not free money (MWIDE would need to pay dividends on the preferred shares), it’s still good money that MWIDE can apply to any number of big infrastructure opportunities around the country.*
>    - **ACEN** [ACEN 6.05 ▼1.14%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=f50efa29ff5009a63470cea4b051ca8f)] decides to proceed with the 400 MW Stubbo Solar project in Australia, located near Wollar and Wellington. The project is scheduled to commence construction later this year, and cost approximately US $513 million (₱30 billion) to construct from start to commissioning. This is ACEN’s second 400 MW solar project in Australia. ACEN is a subsidiary of Ayala Corp [AC 657.00 ▲4.95%] and a component of the Zobel Family’s diversified holdings. 
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *Putting all the nice PR talk aside (400 jobs created, 185k homes powered, etc etc etc), 400 MW is a serious amount of power generation capacity. ACEN is really leaning into Australia as a home away from home for its solar energy development pipeline, with Australia as a major pillar of ACEN’s strategy to achieve its goal of 20 GW of renewable capacity by 2030.*
>    - **SM Prime Holdings** [SMPH 34.00 ▲5.26%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=c5b74865cbeff0653470cea4b051ca8f)] Q3 profit ▲97.5% y/y to ₱7.9 billion. Mall revenues were up 114%. Residential property development revenues were up 32%.
>       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *That’s a really impressive headline, but the better context is that SMPH’s Q3 profit is about 7% higher than its Q2 profit this year. Even better context: SMPH made ₱8.3 billion in profit back in Q3 of 2019. That’s still 5% higher than this year’s result. Three years later and the company still hasn’t stepped out of its 2019 shadow. It’s easy (sometimes) to forget just how much time and money was lost during the pandemic.*

Is it still worth it to get a Masters Degree Abroad?,2,w88v8n,phinvest,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/w88v8n/is_it_still_worth_it_to_get_a_masters_degree/,15,"Hi i'am a 23y/o Female, looking for a full scholarship for a Masters Degree in Visual Arts and Design field. I usually look and read here first before doing a drastic decision in my life so im hoping i could hear/ read your opinions in my situation.

&#x200B;

I work in a fairly good company with a fair amount of salary pay although given to our economic status medyo mahirap hirap na din pagkasyahin yung monthly salary ko given sa bills and such.   
Tho im not a bread winner, in fact bunso nga ako sa pamilya namen with a 10 - 12y/o gap to my siblings pero kasi my siblings doesn't have that kind of financial stability na kaya mag decide for themselves kahit pamilyado na.. Both of them have their own family naman na pero they still kind of ask my dad parin some financial support and such.. i mean that's okay naman but the problem is kasi both of my parents are going 60 na din kasi so malapit na mag retire yung dad ko, hence, wala na syang source of income and im afraid na baka sakin mapunta yung burden ng paying all the bills and food pero kahit fairly good naman yung salary ko halos saktuhan na talaga sya. (20% of my salary goes directly to my emergency fund kasi)  


So yeah, my dad has been motivating me lately to still pursue my studies.. sabi naman nya kasi alam nyang kaya ko syang gawin and i pursue and alam naman nyang hanggang may passion ako to do it gagawin ko talaga. In fact, mga 5x nya naman nabanggit sakin na what if mag aral pa ko and dagdagan ko pa yung knowledge ko, kahit hindi naman kelangan sa field mo lang pero atleast mas maraming knowledge mas maraming options. kaso nga lang sadyang maraming nag hohold off lang sakin like the burden of still being a light burden to my dad kahit malapit na sya mag 60.. i mean syempre regardless naman you still want to help your parents kahit nag pupursue ka ng degree given with the inflation and such alam kong hirap na hirap na din sila talaga mag maintain ng budget. Also, i know may mga masters degree naman here sa philippines regarding art and such pero given with our situation i just thought that having a fresh perspective and wider/diverse knowledge would be better and of course the idea of being independent atleast. Im actually thinking of three countries to choose.. Australia, Japan and New Zealand. Based on my research kasi these three countries offer full scholarship and such, i mean its a much more nicer perspective to learn diverse culture and art perception depending on where you live.  


Do you guys have any ideas on how to achieve them and range kung magkano yung usual na magagastos if ever i pursue yung career? im assuming kasi 1k+$ for australia including the visa, ielts and other fees pero i can manage baka naman may other options which are a lot cheaper pero nandun yung idea still. im planning to arrange all of my documents this year and pursue looking for better options and scholarships by the year 2023. Gusto ko na kasi maging prepared as early as now atleast may malaki akong set back bago mag 2023 and makapag decide na ko by that year.",1658805982.0

Ask yourself din if you are physically, mentally, financially prepared. Nung nasa abroad ako, doon ako nadiagnose ng anxiety and depression.
